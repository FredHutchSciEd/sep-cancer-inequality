It may be observed here that the variance in cost range and age in a city of this size cannot be considered a detrimental influence, as it would be in a metropolitan city.  There are probably 30 new houses being built in this area at the present time, the type of construction being frame, stucco, and brick. The area is zoned for single family residences, and there is no vacancy at the present time. It is well located from the point of view of transportation and educational facilities, as the best car line in the city runs within three or four blocks of any point in the area, and the Fresno High School and Fresno State College are both within a few blocks. Here too it is difficult to define a shrinkage trend during the depression because all the lots before the depression were owned by the development company, which held them until they could be sold to people who were actually going to build on them. There was virtually no sale of improved properties here during the depression. At the present time 60 foot lots are selling for $1,000 to $1,500. There is a sharp difference in the nature of the properties north of Shields Avenue. The three blocks between Shields and Simpson Avenues is much better than the other parts, “C-1”, but as it is such a small area, it was deemed more practicable to extend “C-1” to “A-1” rather than set up a separate “blue” area.'}}},\n",

They are of frame, stucco, or brick construction and most of them are two-story structures. There are two or three houses under construction in the area at the present time, and several others have only recently been completed. Thus again illustrates the fact that in a city of this type and size, with the revival of building, one finds areas which are already pretty well built up suddenly becoming active where there are still vacant lots. The area is practically 100% owner-occupied, and it is just as well located for transportation and educational facilities as “A”-2. The houses in this small area are, for the most part, built on 100 foot lots which are priced at from $2,500 to $3,500 at the present time.

The area is on low ground bounded on the north by a canal (which is dry most of the time), on the east and south by scattered poor developments described under areas “C-1”, and on the west by the main line of the Santa Fe. The interiors of the two rather pretentious residences completed are not very well designed, notwithstanding their pretentious exteriors. At the time of the Fresno survey, none of the houses were sold. Careful inquiry was made concerning this little development, resulting in a good deal of difference of opinion. The majority of people interviewed were unfavorable to this development because of its being on low ground and generally in rather poor surroundings, particularly for properties to sell as high as $15,000. On the other hand, in some quarters, it was felt that this development would be successful. It is perfectly possible that this small section will be one of the best residential districts in Fresno, but because of its situation and the circumstances noted, the area is hatched in “blue” rather than “green”.'}}},\n",

The homes are fairly uniform, the population is stable and substantial, educational facilities excellent, and transportation to the business district of the best. It is occupied for the most part by business and professional people, the remaining population being “white-collared” workers. The income range is from $1,800 to $10,000 a year. In the west central part of the area is located the Fresno High School. In the eastern part of the area is Fresno State College. This college has an enrollment of about 2,500 students, all of whom are housed privately throughout this “blue” district and the surrounding “yellow” districts. A remarkable fact in this connection is that there is no indication of so-called “rooming houses” and very few other multiple unit residences in this area. The area was carefully examined on two different occasions to establish this fact. The houses in the area range from $3,500 to $15,000. The average age is about 15 years, and the range is from new houses to houses 25 years old. Construction is frame, brick, and stucco, with a variety of architectural types. The area is generally protected by racial deed restrictions. The area is zoned for single family residences except on Wishon Avenue between Howard and Weldon and between McKinley and Howard. However, there are very few multiple unit buildings in these zones. The area is about 90% owner-occupied, and there is almost no vacancy at present.'}}},\n",

The hatched area to the east is comprised of fairly new houses and has several houses under construction at the present time. These houses in the main part of the hatched area south of Belmont Avenue are modest, but of good construction. The small hatched section north of Belmont and connected with “B-3” has several new houses going up and is well protected by deed restrictions. The new houses here are in a little higher cost range than those just discussed. The area as a whole is split up by a branch railroad line.

It is occupied largely by business and professional men whose incomes range from $3,000 to $12,000. The area, with the exception of one street, presents a uniform appearance, most of the houses averaging from $5,000 to $8,000. Huntington Boulevard is the exception, and on this street the houses are uniform but are in a higher price range, probably averaging closer to $10,000 and going as high as $35,000, ranging in age from new houses to houses 25 years old. Here is found various types of construction, such as frame, stucco, and brick, and while the average age of the houses throughout the area is perhaps 15 years, there is at the present time a great deal of new construction. The area is protected by deed restrictions calling for a $5,000 minimum cost of construction and excluding colored races. The area is almost 100% owner-occupied, and as far as could be determined, there is not a vacancy in it. It is very hard to establish a shrinkage trend over the depression years in this area because there was almost no change of ownership; even at the low point people living here were permanent residents and were able to hold their properties. There were likewise few transfers of building lots during the depression years, but on the basis of interviews with real estate men, it was thought that a 60-foot lot on Huntington Boulevard, which would have cost $2,000 in 1929, might have been purchased for $1,400 or $1,500 in 1933, and, now that there is renewed activity in the area, the lot would sell for $2,000 or more. Concerning the limited rental property in this neighborhood, a $50 rental in 1929 probably shrank to $35 and is now back to $50. Even a $150 rental only shrank to $100, and it is now renting for $150 again.  Because of the nature of Fresno, its being a rather small city where there is no rapid shifting of residential districts, the relation of the lot value to the improvements of an improved property varies a great deal. For example, a house was built on half a block on Huntington Avenue costing $30,000. The owner later built a $15,000 home on half of this large tract for his daughter. In a large metropolitan area, with its rapidly shifting residential districts, either the $30,000 house would be considered an over-improvement or the $15,000 house would be considered an under-improvement. In a town of this size and nature that does not appear to be the case.'}}},\n",

However, the income level of the people living here is lower, running from about $2,000 to $5,000, and likewise the cost range of the properties is lower, ranging from $3,500 to $8,500. The houses are of frame or stucco construction and are mostly one-story houses of bungalow type. This area has had building and racial restrictions by deed, most of which have now run out. However, it is all zoned for single family residences, and it is claimed the area will maintain its stability for some years to come. It is perhaps 90% owner-occupied, and there is no vacancy in the area at the present. Like \"B-4\", there was little change of ownership among improved properties, and so it was difficult to define a shrinkage trend. Further, there has been virtually no activity in lot sales here for the last few years until the present time. There are very few vacant lots left, and it was felt that a good 50-foot lot in this area in 1929 would sell for $1,200, there was one actual case noted of a lot being sold for $1,000 to $1,200. While this area, it is claimed, will maintain its present level for perhaps 10 years, the factors of decline are present from its age and from the presence of the declining area surrounding it.'}}},\n",

The best houses in the area, which rented for $45 to $50 in 1929, shrank very little during the depression and now are renting for $50 or $55. There has been very little sales activity in this area for several years, and as there were no forced sales noted during depression years, the exact shrinkage and present appreciation cannot be defined.

The main part of the area is fairly uniform in appearance, but the houses are not all of good construction, which, combined with the age factor, accelerated the decline of the whole neighborhood.

The area, as a whole, is 80% owner-occupied, and there are no vacancies at present. There is a very small normal vacancy here. In the part of this area north of Weldon Avenue there are several houses either just completed or still under construction, particularly the small triangle bounded by Weldon Avenue on the south, the railroad on the east, and College Avenue on the west, in which there are five or six houses either newly built or under construction. It is surprising that these well-built new residences are being constructed so near the railroad, with its freight cars on siding, and small businesses on the east side of the tracks. This circumstance is not felt, apparently, to be a detriment, but in grading the area it seemed necessary to penalize these new houses from the point of view of long time mortgage lending risk. The narrow strip further north contains some fairly new houses, with three or four just newly completed homes, while the proximity of the railroad and small industries west thereof penalized this narrow “yellow” strip as a whole, the nature of the improvements offer a good protection for areas “A-2” and “B-2”.'}}},\n",

It is an old residential part of the city where the houses range from new ones to some 50 years old and range in cost from $1,500 to $20,000. Quite a number of the larger old houses have been remodeled into duplexes or four flats, particularly in the middle of the area. The area is occupied by people of all kinds—laborers making $900 to $1,200 a year, artisans making $1,000 to $1,500 a year, small business men, a few professional men, and even some well-to-do people and retired people, whose incomes might be $10,000 or $15,000 per year. In particular, there are two small sections near the main business district of the town where some fine old homes are located, occupied for the most part by the original owners. The area is zoned for business purposes along Belmont, Divisadero, Fort Camp, Fresno Avenues, and First Street, and most of the remaining part of the area is zoned for multiple residential units, churches, clubs, etc. The area is about 60% owner-occupied, and there is scarcely a vacancy to be found. The rentals here range from $20 a month to $75 a month, and the shrinkage during the depression was about 50%. Rents are at present back to the 1929 level. The small hatched area to the north consists of small, inexpensive houses for the most part, which are scattered. There is enough variance in the age, cost, type of construction, and general lack of uniformity so that the trend of this hatched part does not appear to be upward. Further, it has adjacent on the east a very poor type of development in area “D-2”.'}}},\n",

The houses already built average in age about 7 years, ranging from new houses to 12 year old houses, the part of the area west of 12th Street is developing more or less slowly and is not protected by deed restrictions nor zoning.  The houses in this westerly part are of only fair quality, and many of them toward the north are built on acreages. The easterly part of the area is a newer development which was sub-divided for the purpose of interesting small home owners. There are racial restrictions and restrictions requiring an average of 600 square feet to any new residential structure. There is no zoning, as this part, too, is outside the city. This easterly section is practically 100% owner- occupied. There have been several new houses recently completed here and there are four or five under construction at the present time. However, the new building is not of uniformly good construction, and the area shoes varying pride of ownership. Some of the houses are as old as 12 or 13 years.  Most of the people living here have built on from one-half to 2 ½ acre tracts and raise garden stuff and poultry, through which they secure, perhaps, half of their livings. There is a brisk demand for this type of property at the present time, but the development as a whole is uneven, and mortgage loaning should be done cautiously.

The population is approximately 30% foreign born, 50% people of foreign parentage, and 20% people of white  American parentage. The foreign born and people of foreign parentage are generally Germans and Russians with a very slight scattering of colored races. On the whole, the people in this area are frugal and honest—good citizens. Most of them have real equities in their homes, and many of them own their homes free of encumbrance. Throughout the area the cost of the homes ranges from $800 to $2,500, with a few more substantial. The average age of these homes is about 15 years, and there are no new houses and none under construction at present. The area is zoned for single family residences except a few lots zoned for business on Fresno Avenue. California Avenue, however, is a business street. The area is about 90% owner-occupied, and there is no vacancy at present. Normal vacancy runs little more than 5%. The best part of the whole area is a triangular section northwest of Merced Avenue and east of Tehema. This was a development started about 10 years ago, and improvements are more substantial than in the remaining part of the area. However, it is an area isolated from the other desirable residential districts of the city by the main business district and by the large foreign population in “D-4”. Consequently, the area stagnated and is now declining. The hatched section east of the main part of the area contains the same type of population and the same type of improvements as other parts of the area, differing only in the fact that the houses are scattered.'}}},\n",

Population is almost entirely American whites. The neighborhood as a whole is not uniform, and price of ownership is from fair to poor. The houses are on average 12 years old, range in cost from, $600 to $1500, and are virtually all of frame construction. No deed restrictions remain, but it is all zoned for single family residences, with the exception of four blocks in the southwest corner which are zoned industrial. The area is 85% owner-occupied, with no vacancy noted at present. However, there is a normal vacancy of 10% to 15% because the packing houses have a seasonal peak and low point, and the factory workers move in and out. On the west the area pushes up against packing plants and other industries. On the east is undeveloped land.'}}},\n",

This part, as well as the scattered hatched part to the south, lacks uniformity entirely and reflects no pride of ownership.  Some of the houses are mere shacks, and few cost more than $1,500. The average age is 20 to 25 years, and the houses are of cheap, frame construction, or simply “board and bat”, (i.e., structures made by simply laying boards on the ground held together by bats to make the sides. The sides are simply lifted up and tied at the corners without any frame work). There is no new building. The solid “red” part of the area as far as Fig Street is zoned for business. The streets outside of the city limits are not zoned at all. The area is only about 50% owner-occupied, but there is virtually no vacancy in the remaining 50%. The rents, even on the present rising rental market, are as low as $10 to $12 a month. The hatched portion is of the same nature, the houses being scattered.'}}},\n",

Construction and maintenance are of high quality. Architectural designs are harmonious. Location is favorable and attractive. Population is homogeneous. Lots are generally of extra size and sold on \"homesite\" basis and at widely varying prices according to size and location. The pattern of the area is well established and it is accorded a \"low green\" grade.',\n",

This area has been developing intermittently for 25 or 30 years, and is still very sparesely settled. Its appeal is to very wealthy people who desire a sequestered homesite. Construction is of superior quality; maintenance is of the best, and architectural designs are excellent. Population is homoegeneous. Property turn-over is extremely limited and marketability is influenced by consideration of sacrifice sales. Recent improvements have been largely along Madelino Dr., Covington Placo and the section known as Busch Gardens, and are somewhat more modest in size and occupy smaller estates.

Conveniences are all reasonably available for an area of this kind. Development of this area has taken place at various intervals during the past 25 years. Under stimulus of easy financing during past few years there has been considerable building activity, particularly in the section directly south of Colorado Blvd. Construction is of standard quality or better. Maintenance is of good quality indicating pride of ownership. Architectural designs are pleasing and population is homogeneous and of fairly substantial means. Deed restrictions permit of multi-family structures is designated locations and there are several bungalow courts of good quality at Ave. 64 and Colorado Blvd. Adjacent to Anandale Country Club is a favorable factor. Except in section directly south of Country Club there are no uniform paving regulations. This is a particularly hard area to grade, particularly the hatched portion. However, Ave. 64 is the new high speed artery from Pasadena to downtown Los Angeles and this factor in itself has led to a stimulation of the neighborhood. Consequently, grading will be upon the basis where pattern is definitely established, and the grade assigned is “low green”.',\n",

This encircling area is on the whole somewhat newer than the two just previously described and is not nearly so uniform in its improvements. The residences on San Pasqual and California Sts. are of larger size, while in the Southwest part west of Courtland and north of Huntington Dr. are predominantly 6 and 7 room bungalows. In the balance of the area improvements are of mixed types and sizes. Construction, maintenance and architectural designs are uniformly of high character. Population is homogeneous. This area has been quite active during the past few years and land values have shown a rising tendency. Currently lots are selling around $35 per front foot. Schools serving this and other San Marino areas are particularly high class. There is still much room for expansion in this area and indications are that it will continue as a first grade residential section for many years in the future.

During past 3 or 4 years this area has developed into one of the county’s “hot spots”. Construction, which is largely accomplished by FHA Title II financing, is of good standard quality and architectural designs are individually attractive and collectively harmonious. Both population and improvements are homogeneous. An old church, with cemetery surrounding it is situated on the S.P. Ry. between De Sales and San Marino Ave., is a slight drawback to abutting property. The San Gabriel Country Club is a favorable influence. Present indications are that the area will continue its rapid growth and will expand into some of the adjoining vacant districts. This area abuts on area C-46 at extreme northeast corner along Longden Ave., but this is no detriment to property situated there as adjacency to the San Gabriel Country Club more than offsets this disadvantage.

Conveniences, including recreational facilities, are all as available as is desirable for an area of this character. This subdivision is part of the 150 year old Rancho Santa Anita which was purchased by the late “Lucky” Baldwin many years ago and is now part of his estate. This area, A20, A21, and A22, have been subdivided during the past 5 years under the supervision and direction of Raymond A. Dorn and Co. of Pasadena, and are considered models for single family residential subdivisions. This are contains 103 home sites, 23 of which have been improved with others in course of improvement. The sites run from 2/3 to 2 acres and are prices from $1950 to $5500. Improvements, maintenance, architectural designs, and charm of location are ideal, and population is highly homogeneous. Adjacent to Area C-41 on the north is not detrimental to this area as differences in terrain, and the heavy growth of walnut trees serve as physical barriers to influence.

Conveniences are not readily available, transportation being notably inadequate. This, however, is not a serious handicap in a district of this type. This subdivision was placed on the market some little time ago by the Santa Monica Land and Water Company and is being developed in a very orderly and dignified manner. Construction and maintenance are of the highest type and architectural designs are the last word in the art. Population and improvements are highly homogeneous. Marine and mountain views also add to the desirability of the location. Lot values range from $25 to $30 per front foot with some home sites at much higher prices. The area is separated from adjacent lower grade areas by canyons and steep bluffs. There are no derogatory influences and while low percent of land developed precludes other that a provisions “hatches green” grade, there is every indication that eventually it will merit the highest grade.',\n",

Deed restrictions limit improvements to single-family structures, provide for architectural supervision, and protects against subversive racial hazards. Conveniences are not conveniently available. This well-conceived area was subdivided some 14 years ago and has since experienced a consistent growth. Construction and maintenance are of excellent character and architectural designs are harmonious and adds to the charm of the districts. Population, which is largely in the higher income brackets, and improvements are both homogeneous. Many of the home sites are of acreage proportions and are improved horticulturally with citrus orchards, etc. This location has great charm with abroad view of the Pacific Ocean and Santa Monica Mountains. Even its isolation, while making it inaccessible and remote from conveniences, is a favorable factor in this type of district. This will be partially relieved if the projected roadway down Santa Monica Canyon becomes an accomplished fact. Price bracket shown is nominal as size of homes it governs. Land values, while not generally so quoted, will run approximately $30 per front foot. It is felt that the rather severe deed restriction will probably retard development and that growth will be slow. Owing to the low percent of land improved and lack of definite pattern, the area is according a provisional ‘”hatched green” grade.',\n",

This area represents the oldest development in West Los Angeles. It was subdivided from 15 to 20 years ago and has experienced a steady growth. Many improvements are comparatively old but the excellent character of maintenance as kept them modernized. This is one of the best landscaped sections of the city. Construction is of the highest quality and architectural designs leave little to be desired. Population is homogeneous and takes evident pride in their district. The recent influx of motion picture employees has had the effect of raising land values which are now averaging better than $50 per front foot.

This area was first platted in 1924 or 1925 but development has largely taken place in past 4 or 5 years, growth being retarded by litigation over title to canyon lands, which has now been determined.

Improvements are well constructed and highly maintained Architectural designs are uniform and population, which is predominantly of the younger generation, is homogeneous. It is a two-car garage neighborhood. Lots values vary from $1000 to $1500. The area is a popular one and trend of desirability is definitely upward.

The “Hidden Village” section is said to have a lower minimum cost for improvements. Conveniences are all readily available. The portion of area known as Toluca Lake was subdivided some 8 or 9 years ago, but intensive development has taken place within the past 5 years. The Hidden Village section is a recent subdivision and is less than 10% improved but growing rapidly. In fact, this area is one of the high grade “hot spots” in the County. Construction and maintenance are of excellent quality; architectural designs are attractive and harmonious. Population is homogeneous, and a high degree of community pride is indicated. The location is admirable, being within walking distance to both Universal and First National Motion Picture Studios and easily accessible from Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles. Proximity to Lakeside Golf Course and the bridle trails and other recreational features of Griffith Park are also favorable influences.

Highest type deed restrictions, which are rigidly enforced, protect in perpetuity against racial hazards and provides minimum improvement costs and requires architectural supervision. Zoning limits improvements to single-family residences and provides for uniform placement of improvements. Due to type of occupancy, transportation is entirely by privately owned automobiles or taxi service. Proximity to Westwood and Beverly Hills provides conveniently available schools, churches, trading and amusement centers. This area consists of three subdivisions: Bel-Air, Holmby Hills and Beverly Estates, all of which have been developed within the past 15 years in an orderly manner and under efficient sponsorship. This area represents, without question, the highest type of residential construction and maintenance in Los Angeles County. Homesites range in size to from 2 to 15 acres, which sell for from $7500-12500 per acre. Cost pf three recent improvements, including sites in Holmby Hills, were reported to be $80000, $100000, and $110000. It is noticeable that new construction is along conservative lines but represents the highest type of architectural skill. Extensive improvements of less pretentious character, in a price range of $25000-$35000, have taken place in Stone Canyon and tributary valleys in the past 3 years. Sales demand in the area is good. It should be borne in mind, however, that for sale purposes there is normally a high ratio of depreciation from cost prices in improvements of the mansion type. The trend of desirability is definitely upward in this area and it is accorded the “highest green” grade.',\n",

This area was subdivided some 7 or 8 years ago under the sponsorship of the Janss Investment Corporation, high grade subdividers who have been principally responsible for development of a large part of the section known as “Westwood”. Development was retarded during its earlier years but has been active during the past 4 or 5 years. The chief characteristics of the district are its isolated seclusion and highly homogeneous population. Architectural designs are also harmonious and improvements and maintenance are of good quality. Average Homesites currently sell for around $2500, according to size and location. This area is somewhat overshadowed by other more pretentious nearby area.

The area is highly protected by deed restrictions and the zoning ordinances of the City of Beverly Hills are also considered highly protected. Conveniences all readily available. Development of this area began some years ago, and it has been an exceedingly popular district ever since. Improvements are of excellent character and the older homes are constantly being modernized. Maintenance and architectural design add charm to the neighborhood. The platting of the streets show civic pride and adds to the appeal of the whole district. This is a high income section, the majority of the families being in the higher brackets of $10,000 a year and up. Adjoining the area on the east is an unincorporated section of Los Angeles County (area C-73) which is of materially low grade and is a detrimental influences upon the abutting blocks in this area. This is largely minimized, however, by Doheny Drive which separates the two area and the fact that most of the streets in Area C-73 do not extend into this area. Lot values are said to average $100 per front foot. Indications are that this area will maintain its charm and popularity for a great many years to come and it is, therefore, accorded a “high green grade.',\n",

High schools, however, are somewhat distant as are also shopping facilities. Transportation along Cahuenga includes both interurban and bus service. However, this is a two and three car garage neighborhood. Any lack of conveniences will probably be shortly supplied as the area is rapidly developing. This area was first subdivided and placed on the market about 1924 but its greatest period of growth has been within the last four years. Improvements, maintenance and architectural design are of high quality; population is homogeneous and the area is increasing in popularity. The northeast section is more pretentions than the balance of the area. There are some over-improvements in the section south of Cahuenga Blvd. which gives it a somewhat spotted appearance. This, however, will be largely overcome by reason of the large amount of new construction which is takin place. The area lies in the path of the city growth and while there are some dead-end and unimproved streets, this is to be expected in an area which is in the process of development. The residential lot values run around $20 per front foot, some higher.

Conveniences are all as available as could be expected in an exclusive and sequestered neighborhood. This area which lies along the northern border of Burbank and Glendale was subdivided some 20 years ago, and has enjoyed a leisurely but steady growth without undue promotional effort. Construction and maintenance are of excellent quality. Architectural designs are pleasing and population is homogeneous. In the section east of Columbus Ave. improvements will not average over 3 years, and most of the new construction has been in this part. Many dwellings occupy extensive homesites; the “price range” shown, however, covers only nominal land value. The location is a popular one not alone for its altitude and view but also on account of the homogeneity of its middle to higher income level home owners.

This area was subdivided and placed on the market 18 to 20 years ago, which accounts for the admixture of old and new construction. However, improvements are all of good quality and pleasing architectural design. Maintenance indicates a high prude of ownership and the population is homogeneous. When deed restrictions expire in 1943 there may be some encroachment of income property in that section south of Hollywood Blvd., as this part is zoned to permit multi-family construction.

Zoning: single-family residential. Conveniences are all quite readily available in southern part, decreasing to northward, as income and construction costs increase. This area was subdivided some 15 years ago to meet a demand for exclusiveness and seclusion. Engineering and platting have bene of high quality and development within past five years has greatly enhanced the character of the district. Construction, maintenance and architectural design have been excellent and at present the west and northwest portions are enjoying a considerable building activity. Lot prices are largely governed by topography. Population is homogeneous and imrpovements are harmonious. Construction hazards are the cause of high building costs, but this is somewhat offset by easy financing due to large interest in unimproved property by the Bank of America and by appeal of this type of “near in” seclusive property to certain members of the higher income group. On the basis of present activity and outlook the trend of desirability is certainly upward and the area is accordingly given a “low green” grade.',\n",

Conveniences are all readily available. This subdivision was platted into large home sites and placed upon the market about 22 years ago as an exclusive residential district. High pressure salesmanship was not employed and the area developed slowly but steadily. Construction and maintenance are of the highest quality. Architectural designs are harmonious throughout. Population is homogeneous and largely of the upper income group. Authorities generally agree that this is one of the best residential districts in Los Angeles. Many of the improvements are of the mansion type. Proximity of the Wilshire Country Club is a favorable influence. Owing to the constantly increasing business along Wilshire Blvd. the southern tier of blocks adjacent to it are not considered as desirable as the rest of the area. Third St. is an arterial and a traffic hazard. On account of the high percent of land improved it is not felt that the highest grade should be assigned.

While owner occupancy is high, it is quite generally based upon a low equity investment which raises a question as to the economic stability of the district.

The area shown is the first unit of a development which will eventually cover 2.5 sq. miles. Project has been carefully planned, and platting, which follows contours of land, is particularly noteworthy. Location is a favorable one. There is evidence that development has been too rapid and that new imrpovements are not being absorbed readily. It is possible that speculative builders may have to reduce prices to compete with other new imrpovements in this section. Construction, most of which has been financed through FHA Title II loans, is of high standard quality.

Conveniences are all reasonably available for a district of this character. This subdivision was platted and placed on the market some 15 years ago; its growth after the initial promotional effort was erratic until about 4 years ago when activity began to increases. Currently it is one of the “hot spots” of the community. Construction and maintenance are of excellent character. Architectural designs, particularly of new improvements, are individually attractive and harmonious as a whole. Population is homogeneous and show a high degree of neighborhood pride. Proximity to numerous motion picture studios, Country Clubs, and the Pacific Military Academy are considered favorable influences. The location is also a favorable one. Lot values range around $30 per front foot. Plans are under way for immediate development of a section between National Blvd., Motor Ave., Exposition Blvd. and Manning Ave., to be known as Cheviot Knolls. This is immediately adjacent to the area and it is thought will, in time, become a part of it. This is a very desirable and active area and is accorded a “medial green” grade.',\n",

This is the best residential area in Long Beach and is a recent development. Construction is standard quality or better. Maintenance of good quality. Architectural designs are harmonious. Population is homoegeneous. Adjacence to Virginia Country club is a favorable factor. Proximity to oil wells, refineries, etc. is a detrimental influence; however, no odors were detected and informed local opinion is that this factor is not a deterrent. Recent drilling for oil, east of Cherry and south of Carson, brought in a \"dry well\" and a movement is said to be on foot to get the county to zone against future operations of this kind. If this is successful it is said that vacant property east of California and south of San Antonio Drive will be subdivided and developed in harmony with this area. This is a \"hot spot\" and lots are selling from $1000 and up, according to size and location. Location of this area is very favorable and a continued upward trend is indicated. It is therefore accorded a \"medial green\" grade.',\n",

Deed restrictions provide for minimum improvement cost of $6000 with construction supervised by subdividers. Restrict ownership to the Caucasian race in perpetuity. All providers are strictly enforced. Deed restrictions formerly provided for a much higher minimum cost of improvement but were modified as above some 5 years ago. Conveniences are very largely lacking. Schools, churches, trading centers and transportation all being inadequate. This area was formerly part of an old Spanish grant which was taken over by Frank Vanderlop, formerly Secretary of Treasury, who began active development in 1923. Compared with other sections of the city development has been exceedingly slow. Modification being at a peak at the present time. The location has great charm and offers a magnificent view of the Pacific Ocean. Construction and maintenance are of excellent quality. Architectural designs are of the best and population is highly homogeneous. The area is protected from the adverse influence of area C-161 to the north by virtue of the hill terrain. Improvements range from expensive 6 room dwellings to mansions with large surrounding estates. There is no predominating type. One authority ventures the opinion that “Palos Verdes Estates” is one of the highest class subdivisions is Southern California. The northern part of this area (north of the Palos Verdes line) is a separate subdivision known as “Hollywood Riviera”. The characteristics of this section are very similar those of Palos Verdes Estates; however, deed restrictions have not been modified and minimum improvement requirements are so high that land improved is only about 5%, and it is not believed that a successful development is feasible until some adjustment of restrictions is made. This subdivision was placed upon the market some 25 years ago. Under normal conditions this area, as a whole, should make rapid strides during the next 10 years and it is assigned a “hatched green” grade.',\n",

Conveniences are as yet inadequate. Being a two-car garage neighborhood the effect of this is minimized. This area was subdivided within the past 10 years, but active development has occurred within past 5 years. The location is one of great charm and affords a magnificent view of San Pedro Harbor and the Pacific Ocean beyond. The parkways are beautifully landscaped and well kept. Construction and maintenance are of excellent character. Architectural designs are harmonious and add greatly to the attractiveness of the area. Population is highly homogeneous. The subdivision is under the same supervision as that of Palos Verdes Estates.

Deed restricted to single family dwellings with minimum improvement costs, and protection against racial hazards in perpetuity. Zoning conforms to deed provisions. Conveniences are all reasonably available for this type of neighborhood. Development of this area commenced some 20 years ago, and has been gradual. It is currently experiencing its greatest activity. Construction and maintenance are of excellent quality. Architectural designs are appealing and population is homogeneous. Land is valued on home site basis and front foot prices are not quoted. A number of large walled-in estates are located here and most improvements have generous sites. The area is characterized by charm of location, expansive views and ready accessibility. There are no serious detrimental influences and trend of desirability is distinctly upward. The area, therefore, is accorded a “low green” grade.',\n",

Probably 40% of acreage suitable for residential development is covered by present improvements, although only about 10% of the land in the area is developed. Deed restrictions provide for minimum improvement cost of $7500, architectural supervision and racial restrictions in perpetuity. Zoning is single family residential. Conveniences are not readily available. This exclusive and sequestered district was subdivided in 1925 and has been slowly developed since that time. A re-subdivision of some of the large acreage plots was recently made with the mutual consent of all property owners of the area. This will undoubtedly stimulate further development as the district is very highly regarded. Construction, architectural designs and maintenance are of the very highest character. It is not practical to designate a predominating type and size or to give price brackets as extent of home sites largely govern prices. In a general way it might be states that estates have cost owners from $25000 to $1000000. The area has been very carefully developed and population is homogeneous, and has a high community pride. Remoteness and comparatively small number of improvements preclude assignment of the highest grade, but it is thought that pattern and prospects are definite enough to warrant assignment of a “medial green” grade.',\n",

Churches and trading centers are somewhat distant from parts of area. Transportation is inadequate; however, this is two-car neighborhood. This area which is composed of several subdivisions has been slowly developing for 25 years or more. Activity has increased somewhat during the past 5 years, the new improvements being largely of the bungalow type. Construction, maintenance and individual architectural designs are of excellent character. The wide range in size of improvements detracts from the harmony of the area. Population is h homogeneous. The altitude approximates 2,000 feet and the location is particularly attractive to those desiring a high dry climate; on the other hand, proximity to the mountains results in a summer climate several degrees warmer than in area to the south. This is said to affect salability somewhat. Adjacent to the Pasadena Gold Club and Altadena Recreational Center are favorable influences.

Schools, churches and trading centers are conveniently available. Transportation is dependent upon bus service. This area consists of a number of subdivisions ranging in age from 5 to 15 years. The southeast section was a speculative subdivision; the streets were improved, sidewalks and curbs put in and even ornamental lighting was installed, but sales promotion produced no activity and the project went sour. Under stimulus of FHA financing it is beginning to show some signs of life. It is thought that street and other improvements were too elaborate for the people who would naturally be attracted to the location. In the balance of the area, street and other improvement were of much more modest character and it has had a rapid development. The area is a well located workingmen’s district, most of the population being employed in adjacent tire and rubber factories. Construction is generally of standard quality. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy. Architectural designs are attractive. Population and improvements are homogeneous. There are a number of small multi-family dwellings scattered throughout.

New construction is of standard quality, but older improvements were largely substandard. Maintenance is somewhat spotted but usually of good character. The population, which is on the whole homogeneous, is composed of skilled artisans employed in nearby rubber and tired factories, and other industries. Owing to mixture of older structures and difference in architectural designs parts of the area have a somewhat heterogeneous aspect.

There is quite a little activity in the eastern section also. New improvements are quite generally financed by GHA Title II insured loans and construction is of good to extra standard quality. Maintenance and architectural designs are of excellent quality and population is homogeneous. There are four small apartment houses in the older section which are designed to conform to single-family improvements. Land values range from $20 per front foot upward, which is considered somewhat high for the location. Desirability is on the upgrade and 7 room stuccos with 2 baths are selling for as high as $7500.

This is a recent subdivision placed on the market within the past 5 years, and promoted as a rural suburban district of Los Angeles. Development under the influence of FHA Title II financing, has been moderately active and has resulted in fairly rapid growth. Construction is of standard quality. Maintenance bids fair to be of good character. Architectural designs are in keeping with the citrus grove environment and is appealing. Population, many of whom are employed in Los Angeles or are retired people are attracted by the moderately priced large homesites, is homogeneous. Lots are stabilized at prices ranging from $10 to $15 per front foot. A number of the improvements are large and older, being the orchard homes of original owners. Improvements along 7th St. and in southern part of area are less uniform in character and are generally less attractive.

This area was subdivided some 10 years ago and was quite active for a brief period. It was largely dormant during the depression years but, under influence of FHA financing, became fairly active again some 3 years ago, but building has apparently again slackened during the past year. Construction, maintenance and architectural designs are above average in quality. Population and improvements give the impression of harmony ad there is evident pride of ownership, and the surrounding citrus orchards also lend a certain charm. Regardless of all of those favorable factors the area seems to lack popular appeal, probably for the reason that it is strung along a single street which is heavily traveled artery. Competition with the well promoted new area to the west of Downey may also be an adverse influence. The area gives the impression of being a misplaced development, and in the absence of intelligent promotional effort, it is thought that it will decreasing considerably in desirability within the next ten years.

This is the best part of the incorporated town of Southgate, development of which began between 15 and 20 years ago. This area was overburdened with overlapping Ad Valorem tax districts, which retarded development until the bonds were redeemed and an adjustment made in the early part of 1938. Since then building activity, under stimulus of FHA Title II financing, has been very great, particularly in southwest portion, and a complete reversal of trend has taken place. Construction of older dwellings were of only fair standard quality, but current building is of much higher quality. Maintenance is generally of good character. Owing to a wide differential in age and architectural designs, the area has a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Population is inclined to be homogeneous. The area is primarily a higher income workingman’s district and is admirably located for such use.

Lack of privacy is apparently an objectionable feature. However, this particular tract has seemingly found ready sale at prices of from $2800 to $4000.

It was dormant for a number of years but, under stimulus of FHA Title II financing and rapid development of adjacent areas to the east, it has become mildly active during the past few years.

Population is homogeneous and many improvements are of mansion type with well-kept grounds. Architectural designs, however, differ greatly and are not harmonious. Some of the old homes lack paint and look slightly “frayed”. Proximity to oil wells is detrimental factor, on account of odors when wind is form their direction. Otherwise the area has an excellent location. Adjacence to Virginia Country Club is a favorable influence.

That part of the area east of Livingston Drive and Nieto St. improvements, while of the same general class as rest of area, will average newer and a large part of the new construction has been in this section. There are a number of 4-family dwellings in this district. Construction and maintenance throughout the area are of excellent quality. Architectural designs of single and multi-family structures are harmonious. Population is harmonious pride of occupancy is very evident. Lot prices range from $40 to $1000 per front foot.

Deed restrictions vary but all are said to be effective and afford protection against racial hazards. Conveniences are all readily available. This area is composed of subdivisions known as “Belmont Shores” and “Naples”, both being in the nature of high grade beach resort developments. However, there are an increasing number of permanent residences being built, and the area has been very active during the past 3 or 4 years. Construction is of high standard quality and maintenance is of good character. Architectural designs are generally attractive but undersized lots and irregular platting gives parts of area a crowded aspect. Owing to lack of uniformity in size, lot values are hard to estimate; based upon a 120 ft. depth they will probably range from $25 to $50, probably more for frontages on the Rivo Alto Canal, which are 30 ft. with little depth. In spite of shifting nature population gives the impression of homogeneity. Occupancy is irregular and changes with the seasons; for the same reason rentals are not constant and brackets shown above are only nominal and are upon a yearly lease basis. Across the Marine Stadium, which borders are on the northeast, are some producing oil wells, but they are apparently not considered a detrimental factor. This are will grade from “low” to “high blue” in different parts with spots showing a “yellow” tinge. However, on the whole, there is evidently an upward trend of desirability and it is believed to merit a “medial blue” grade.',\n",

Conveniences are all readily available, sewerage system not fully installed as yet. This area was subdivided in sections between 1920 and 1923 and some street improvements such as curbs and walks were installed; however, development was begun too late to catch the building boom of that period. Most of the area was subsequently acquired by the building boom of that period. Most of the area was subsequently acquired by the institutions which financed the subdividers, and development was not resumed until the creation of the FHA. With the willing cooperation of the institutional owners and stimulus of FHA Title II financing, speculative builders became active in the area and it has been one of the “hot spots” during the past 2 or 3 years. While the area has been highly promoted, construction, although of the speculative variety, is generally of a good standard grade and maintenance shows pride of ownership. Architectural designs, while not wholly uniform, are attractive. The population while as yet unregimented is inclined to be homogeneous. Growth of the area has been so rapid and highly promotional that, although 40% developed, it is not felt the pattern of the district is definitely established, and for that reason a “low blue” grade is assigned.',\n",

This area is composed of two subdivisions - Griffiths Park Manor located north of Alameda St. and Riverside Ranchos to the south. Both of these subdivisions are well and similarly deed restricted. Minimum improvements of $3500, designs and construction subject to approval of subdividers. Racial protection is also provided. Restrictions are for a period of 25 years. Conveniences are all readily available, including interurban bus service and proximity to Griffiths Park, with its recreational facilities and bridle trails. The subdivisions composing this area have been placed upon the market within the past three years and has since been one of the community’s “hot spots”. Construction is of excellent quality and maintenance shows high pride of ownership. Architectural designs are highly artistic and harmonious, and population is homogeneous and congenial. Promotional effort has been particularly directed to young couples who are interested in horseback riding, golf, and other sports. This has been done by capitalizing on the advantages along this line afforded by the facilities in nearby Griffiths Park. Owing to its elevation, adjacency to the Los Angeles River does not constitute a flood hazard. An industrial section, in which is located a diary and public stables, adjoins this area on the east and is a definitely unfavorable factor. Lot values are quoted at from $775 to $1180 per home site. Indications are that this area will reach a higher grade but it is though that “high blue” designation more nearly depicts the present situation.',\n",

Deed restricted in part but provision loosely drawn. Zoning is mostly single-family with multi-family permitted in parts. Availability of conveniences varies with location, from fair to good. Development of this area, which began some 20 years ago, has been irregular, then distinct waves of activity having been experienced, the last of these beginning in 1936 under stimulus of FHA financing, has been the most intense and is still under way. This intermittent activity has resulted in a spotted and more or less inharmonious aspect. New construction is of much better quality than the old, being of standard quality or better. This has had the effect of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy and architectural designs are generally attractive. There are many scatter blocks located near arroyos or below steep hillsides where there are real flood or landslide hazards. However, well-conceived control projects have done much to minimize such dangers and in many cases such hazards are more mental than real. Las Encino’s Canyon properties have suffered most in the past from this menace. The area is an isolated one and, as has been indicated, is inclined to heterogeneity, and this is particularly true of the section west of Canada Blvd. The greatest activity has been in the northern part of the area and it is there that most of the multi-family structures are located. These are built in harmony with other improvements and are not considered subversive. The area as a whole and the surrounding hills are more or less heavily wooded and, while apparently not so considered, seems to offer a very definite fire hazard. The current trend of desirability in this area is distinctly upward, but it is there accorded a “low blue” grade.',\n",

This is a new subdivision which has been developed within the last 5 years under the stimulus of promotional effort and FHA financing. Construction meets the administration’s requirements and architectural designs are attractive although it is obvious that some of them have been built speculatively. Population, which is of the medium income level, is homogeneous, maintenance evidences pride o ownership. Favorable influences are: consistency and newness of improvements, proximity to good schools, regular “set backs” and excellent street improvements. Negative influences: proximity to industry, Southern Pacific Railway and Grand Central Airport. It also might be mentioned that high percent of home ownership is due to low equity financing and that properties are form 10% to 15% overpriced. The trend of desirability will, it is thought, be upward until promotional effort ceases and will then become static. The area is therefore accorded a “medial blue” grade. Note: there are a number of multiple family dwellings in “business district” shown on map.',\n",

A highly deed restricted and controlled area with ample protection against racial hazards. Conveniences are not readily available, but not detrimental in area of its class. This somewhat isolated area was subdivided some 20 years ago as an exclusive and seclusive district. Prohibitive deed restricted are said to have retarded development. Construction and maintenance are of highest character. Architectural designs are dignified and in keeping with natural charm of the district, and population is homogeneous. Peace, quietude and dignity are outstanding characteristics. Improvements are less imposing in southwest portion. Proximity to Chevy Chase Country Club and unique location are favorable influences. Minor flood threats in periods of heavy rainfall and apparent forest fire hazards are undoubtedly derogatory factors but are apparently not seriously considered. Owing to low degree of activity and lack of popularity an upward trend is not expected; continued desirability will, however, extend far into the future.

Deed restrictions are quite moderate in their provisions, but afford racial protection. Zoning: single-family residential. Conveniences are all available but transportation is dependent upon bus service. This area was subdivided some 15 years ago, but owing to rugged nature of terrain did not prove popular. In the past 2 or 3 years, however, under stimulus of promotional effort and FHA financing, activity has greatly increased. Construction, particularly the new imrpovements, is of goo character. Maintenance in general indicates pride of occupancy, and population is homogeneous. Architectural designs and “set backs” lack uniformity and this with widely varying age tends to give the area a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Proximity to Forest Lawn Cemetery affects adjacent property adversely. It is thought area will remain desirable for some time to come and it is accorded a “low blue” grade.',\n",

Transportation is generally inadequate and is largely dependent upon private conveyance. Buses make schools readily available. Churches and trading centers are generally remote. This large area, which is more like a “countryside” than a residential district, started to develop in the early 20’s. A majority of streets or thoroughfares are paved roads without sidewalks, and there is no sanitary sewerage system. Construction is of standard quality or better and maintenance indicates high pride of ownership. Population although of wide income range is homogeneous. Architectural designs are generally individually attractive. FHA Title II financing has been very stimulating and there is no evidence of high pressure promotional effort. However, indications are that activity will be slower from now on. The northern part of this area south of Fairmount Place and Hacienda Drive along Alta Canada Blvd. is developing rapidly and gives evidence of developing into a first grade area. This whole “countryside” gives evidence of an upward trend and, as a whole, seems to warrant a provisional “high blue” grade.',\n",

Conveniences are available but not readily so. Transportation is by bus. Most streets are improved but are generally short dead-end thoroughfares emanating from Linda Vista Avenue. This area was originally a chicken ranch district, and its transition to a residential section began about 1925. Street and other improvements were financed through an issue of Ad valorem Tax Bonds, popularly known as Mattoon District Bonds. This indebtedness in conjunction with the depression retarded development, and it was not until the bond issue was refunded and the advent of the FHA that activity was resumed. Population, improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are all of a heterogeneous character. Many of the old 4 and 5 room ranch type bungalows are still in existence and in spite of many new well-constructed dwellings they give the area a spotted appearance. Distance from conveniences, poor transportation facilities and lack of deed restrictions are also unfavorable factors. Favorable influences are: large number of high grade improvements, rapid increase of better quality inhabitants, and indications of continuance of building activity. While future is somewhat enigmatic, and will not permit of first grade designation at this time, it is believed that progress has been sufficient to warrant a “medial blue” grade.',\n",

Deed restrictions have largely expired except provisions protecting against subversive racial elements. Zoning is single-family residential. Conveniences are all readily available. This area has been slowly developing, without high pressure salesmanship, for the past 30 years. Many original owners are still residents, occupying the palisades overlooking the “Arroyo Seco” in which is located the far-famed “Rose Bowl” and less known but important “Municipal Golf Course”. This area is popular with retired people and visitors seeking winter quarters. Improvements, while heterogeneous on account of age, are splendidly maintained. Under stimulus of FHA Title II financing there has been quite a little activity in new construction during the past few years. This has been of good quality and has been largely concentrated in two comparatively small sections – one located between Canada Blvd. and Howard St. east of Channing Way, improvements have had a favorable influence upon the area. Unfavorable factors are the fourth grade areas to the west, which are heavily infiltrated with subversive racial elements. Deed protection against these racial hazards protect this area from direct contamination but are, nevertheless, a bad influence. Efforts are being made to overcome this hazard. In many respects this area has first grade qualifications but age and the racial situation precludes assigning better than a medial blue grade.',\n",

This area has been developing steadily for more than 25 years and is still comparatively active. Construction is of standard quality or better and maintenance indicates a high pride of occupancy. Population is homogeneous, the district being particularly favored by the business men of the community. Variance in size and types of improvements gives a heterogeneous aspect to parts of area. Convenience of location and stability are outstanding characteristics. Proximity to Pasadena Gold Club and Altadena Recreational Center are favorable influences. Prevalence of age and obsolescence are derogatory factors. Indications are that the area will remain desirable for a number of years to come and it is accorded a “medial blue” grade. Terrain: Level with considerable slope from north to south. Construction hazards. Land improved 90%. Zoning: single-family residential with stated locations permitting limited multi-family structures. Conveniences are all readily available, transportation facilities being particularly good. Development of area began some 20 years ago and district has experienced consistent growth. Construction is generally of standard quality and maintenance indicates pride of occupancy. Architectural designs are inclined to be heterogeneous owing to age differentials, but improvements are not inharmonious. Population is homogeneous being largely of the lower medium income bracket. The area is characterized by its accessibility, favorable location and stability. Well-kept gardens add to its charm and largely offset a somewhat crowded aspect due to undersized lots. This is a popular home and rental area and will maintain its desirability for a number of years to come. It is therefore accorded a “low blue” grade.',\n",

Much of area is still in citrus orchards and unplatted, but are said to be in line for early development. Construction and maintenance are uniform and of high character.

Maintenance, while somewhat spotted, is generally of good quality. Population is highly respectable and homogeneous. Improvements are of many periods and is heterogeneous from the standpoint of architectural designs.

Deed restrictions which cover important parts of area are ample, well enforced and protect against racial hazards. Conveniences are available but are not all readily so. This far-flung and irregular area is largely of recent development. In the past few years under stimulus of FHA Title II financing it has been, and currently is, very active in the construction of small to medium sized homes. Along East Orange Grove Avenue the improvements are more pretentious and really lend a background to the more modest imrpovements on the side and other streets. Construction is of standard to better quality. Maintenance is of good character and indicated high pride of occupancy. Architectural designs, while individually appealing, lack somewhat in uniformity of designs, being a mixture of one and two-story structures, which gives to some parts of the area a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. The “red” area to the east has no influence upon this area as the two are separated by the “Eaton Wash” which is quite wide at this point. This area is by no means fully developed and should not be disassociated from the “green” area which it surrounds, as it is probable that in time parts of this area will be joined with the “green” area. This area is more than “still desirable” but can currently only be assigned a “medial blue” grade.',\n",

Zoning is single-family residential. Conveniences are all readily available. This area together with “Grand Ave. District” constitutes the old aristocratic residential section of Pasadena and has a nationwide reputation. Many of the structures are 50 years old. Approximately 10% of improvements are of the mansion type occupying from one to five acres and costing in some cases up to $1,000,000. A typical structures of this kind is the 30 to 40 room residence of Phil Wrigley, which occupies the whole block on the west side of Orange Grove Ave. between Arbor and Lockhaven Streets. Many nationally known captains of fiancé and industry maintain homes in this area. During the past several years new arterial shave been constructed which greatly accelerate auto travel to Los Angeles. This has attracted Los Angeles business and professional men to this area and many new 6 to 8 room homes have been constructed. The new improvements have been largely built along Bradford and Bellefontaine Sts. In the southern part of area below Columbia St. Lot values in the area run up to $125 per front foot on Orange Grove Ave. and range from $30 to $50 per front foot in the area as a whole. These prices seem out of proportion compared with lot values in other parts of the city. While this area has many of the qualifications of a first grade area and the district will undoubtedly retain its desirability as a single-family residential section for a great many years to come, the average age of improvements and the large number which are “for sale” precludes assignment of better than a “high blue” grade.',\n",

Many professors and scientists connected with Cal-Tech are residents. Construction is of standard or better quality, maintenance is of good character, population is homogeneous and architectural designs are harmonious. There are many student boarding houses and multi-family dwellings which are detrimental influences.

This area known as Santa Anita Village which has been recently platted contains 58 building sites, 24 of which are said to have been sold at prices ranging from $695 to $1095. There are no completed improvements in this subdivision although construction has started upon several in the past few weeks. Deeds provide for racial restrictions in perpetuity and limit improvements to 1200 sq. ft. which must be constructed under architectural supervision. This development is being marketed under the same sponsorship as areas A-19, A-20, and A-21, and the same general description and characteristics will apply to this area. The location, however, is not deemed so desirable, and building requirements permits smaller structures. The area is assigned a provision “low green” grade. Terrain: Level to rolling. No construction hazards. Land improved 60%. Many large Homesites. Deed restrictions provide against racial hazards, and supervision of improvements, etc. Schools, churches and trading centers are reasonably available. Transportation is limited to interurban line of Huntington Drive. This district was originally developed by citizens from Michigan, Illinois and Indiana, which accounts for its name. Earlier developments were large size dwellings surrounded by small acreage estates. Later imrpovements have consisted of well-maintained 5 and 6 room bungalows of standard construction and attractive architectural designs. While not a sustenance homestead area, practically all Homesites are of sufficient size to permit garden tracts and small orchards. Population is homogeneous and evinces a general community pride. The price brackets shown above are nominal only as amount of land involved governs prices. Adjacent high grade area to the west is favorable influence. Some scattered chicken ranches in the area is a detrimental factor. Indications are that this area will remain desirable for many years to come and it is accorded a “medial blue” grade.',\n",

Deed restrictions cover large part of area and are said to be enforced. Zoning is largely single-family residential. Conveniences are all readily available. This is one of the oldest sections of South Pasadena, early development being in the nature of small estates. The area is far-flung following to some extent a hilly section known as Monterey Hills. It is a popular district with those having business in Los Angeles, and its population to a great extent is made up of Los Angeles business and professional people. Construction ranges from standard to superstandard quality. Maintenance is of good character and in many cases mitigates age and obsolescence. Architectural designs of improvements are of great variety and this, together with a large variance in age, gives the area a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Population is fairly homogeneous, although there is a wide differential in incomes. The area contains many large old live oak trees which add to its charm and desirability. Conveniences to Los Angeles is one of the location’s chief attractions. While development has never been very active its growth has been quite steady and there are indications that its trend of desirability is still upward. However, until this is more apparent than at present it is thought best to assign to the area a “medial blue” grade.',\n",

Deed restrictions have expired but pattern of improvements are definitely established and racial hazards are at a minimum. Zoning is mixed single-family and multiple family. Conveniences all readily available including rapid transit to Los Angeles. This is the most popular and best district in South Pasadena and, although some 30 years old, many original owners are still occupants. Construction is largely extra standard. Maintenance is of character that offsets age and obsolescence. Architectural designs, with few exceptions, are attractive and as a whole are harmonious. Population is homogeneous. The section bounded by as a whole are harmonious. Population is homogeneous. The section bounded by Monterey Road, Garfield Avenue, Oak Avenue and Milan Avenue would almost merit a first grade classification. The area as a whole will undoubtedly trend toward rental properties on account of the natural advantages of its location, being not only close to conveniences but also to Los Angeles transportation. Lot values are stabilized at around $25 to $30 a front foot. This area should retain its desirability for many years to come and is accorded a “high blue” grade. Terrain: Level to rolling with a grade from north to south running from an elevation of 2000 ft. to 1500 ft. No construction hazards. It is difficult to estimate the land improved owing to fact that homesites run from 1 to 20 acres. Deed restriction shave expired upon 75% of area and more will expire on January 1, 1940. An effort to renew or extend provisions providing racial protection is meeting with success. This unincorporated territory is under County government whose zoning ordinances are inadequate. Public transportation is inadequate, shopping centers are distant from parts of area. Schools are good and readily available, and church facilities are convenient. Up to 1905 this area was largely citrus groves, and development began by the purchase of these groves by eastern people for winter homes, who replaced the ranch homes with imposing mansions. This, by and large, is the pattern of the area. Many of the old being super standard. Maintenance, likewise, shows high pride of possession. Architectural designs, as well as landscaping, are individualists and add glamour to the district. This area gives evidence of having been the “melting pot” of the upper income brackets of the nation. This is indicated by the wholesale manner in which indigenous plant life of the various sections of our nation have been injected into the decorative features of those various estates. Horticultural and floricultural novelties of all sections of the nation have been introduced into the decorative scheme of the various holdings. The evergreens of the eastern seaboard and Pacific Northwest are particularly in evidence, and on New Year’s Eve, Santa Anita Avenue is a blaze with an electrical display from these evergreens which border that thoroughfare. There is, however indications of a transition in the area. While many original owners are still residents, properties are more and more passing into control of 2nd and 3rd generation owners. This is definitely suggested by the fact that within the past few years several of these old estates, which for various reasons, have become alienated from original owners, have been subdivided; the old mansions demolished and less pretentious structures and grounds have taken their place. This is particularly obvious in the district between Calaveras and Mariposa Sts. and Santa Anita and El Molino Aves. In this district at least one old estate has been subdivided and 20 new 5 to 7 room bungalows of modern design and extra standard construction have been erected on generous sized lots to take the place of the old improvements. Demolition of another original old mansion was observed in another part of the area. What this portended could not be learned, but there is no doubt that this district is in a transition period. If imagination were allowed full sway, based upon recent developments, a 1st grade might logically be assigned, based upon residential desirability over the next 10 or 15 years. However, the area as a whole gives no such optimistic indication and, based upon present definite prospects, it is thought that all that is justified is a grade of “high yellow” with the suggestion that a future survey will break the area down into several grades.',\n",

This area was subdivided in 1925 and its development was arrested by the depression. It again became active some 3 years ago and number of improvements have practically doubled since. Los Tunas Drive, the main business thoroughfare, traverses the area and is a traffic hazard. There are also a number of multi-family structures along this street. Construction is of standard quality or better. Maintenance is of good character. Architectural designs are individually attractive, but two periods of active development – 10 years apart – have had the effect of marring the uniformity of improvements. Population is apparently homogeneous. Proximity to San Gabriel Country Club and higher grade area to the north are favorable influences. Although topographically and deed protected against the large Mexican district to the south this is deemed a detrimental factor. Their gnarled old trees border Live Oak Ave. and make of that thoroughfare a shaded arbor of great charm. This area is certainly a desirable one and indications are that the trend is still upward.

Conveniences are available but not conveniently so. There are no sewers and many streets are unimproved. This is a recent subdivision, placed on the market between 2 and 3 years ago. Early development was largely accomplished through FHA Title I class 3 financing but currently this has been abandoned and FHA Title II substituted. Construction ranges from standard to substandard quality. Maintenance indicates pride of ownership and architectural designs are attractive. Population, while apparently homogeneous, is of the low income group. Improvements are said to be speculatively built and are not moving readily. The location is barren of verdure which gives it a drab appearance.

Construction is generally of standard quality and maintenance indicated pride of ownership. Improvements, owing to age differentials, give the area a somewhat heterogeneous aspect, and population is inclined to be heterogeneous on account of season character of occupancy.

This area was formerly developed as a Botanical Garden. This project was abandoned some years ago and subdivision followed. Construction and maintenance are of excellent character and architectural designs are harmonious and add to charm of area. Population, which is largely in the higher income brackets, is homogeneous. Land is usually sold on Homesites basis but runs from $25 to $30 per front foot. Detrimental factors include: lack of conveniences including transportation, flood hazard owning to inadequate draining facilities, danger of canyon or brush fires, and inadequate paving. It is thought that high requirements in deed restriction s may prove a deterring factor. With the pattern not definitely established this is a difficult area to grade. It is, however, assigned a provisional “hatched blue” grade.',\n",

Conveniences are all available but not readily so in some parts of area. Transportation is inadequate. This extensive area, which includes a number of subdivisions which have been developed within the past 16 years, was only sparsely improved until some 3 or 4 years ago when, under the stimulus of Douglas Aircraft Co. expansian and FHA requirements. Maintenance is of good quality and population is homoegeneous. Improvements are of attractive architectural designs and the area generally is of harmonious appearance. Street lighting and paving, sewers and some sidewalks are not yet all provided but are said to be on the way. There are some low spots in western part which may prove to be a drainage problem. There are a few small multi-family structures in the area and two or three years ago a small number of Title I homes were built. These will not be increased as present FHA policy does not permit mixing Title I and Title II construction. Lot values run from $10 to $15 per front foot and are said to be rising. This is an attractive workingmen\\'s area and when its pattern is more definitely formed should be broken down and regarded. In the meantime a \"low blue\" grade is accorded.',\n",

Zoning is single-family residential with provision for trading center at intersection of Hellman Ave. and Ramona Blvd., and multi-family dwellings in certain specified blocks. No structure can occupy less than 5000 sq. ft. Conveniences are all readily available. Interurban transportation to Los Angeles is particularly good and fares cheap. This area is subdivided some 12 or 14 yeras ago but there was very little development until 1935. Since that time, under stimulus of well directed sales effort and FHA Title II financing, the district has been somewhat of a \"hot spot\". Construction is all of standard quality or better. Maintenance shows high pride of ownership. Architectural designs are attractive and harmonious. Population is homoegeneous, largely comuters to Los Angeles. Lot values are comparatively reasonable running around $20 per front foot. There are a few small multiple family dwellings in the eastern part, largely along Hellman Ave., but those blend with single-family improvements. Owing to its closeness to Los Angeles and the convenience and cheapness of transportation, the future of area seems assured. It is a favorite lending territory for all classes of mortgage institutions. The area south favorite lending territory for all classes of mortgage institutions. The area south of Hellamn Ave. is of distinctly lower quality and the improvements older and less homogeneous. This same criticism can be directed at the extreme western portion of the area along Churnwood Ave. and Westmont Dr. There is a difference of opinion as to rating of this area, running from \"high B\" to \"med.

Deed restrictions provide for minimum cost of $3500, and sets up racial protection. Both restrictions and zoning limit improvements to single-family residence but provide for multi-family dwellings on Beverly Glen Road and business structures on Westwood Blvd. Conveniences are all readily available. This area was subdivided about 15 years ago. Early development was not rapid and many of the improvements that period were of questionable construction. During the past five years activity has steadily increased and currently it is a “hot spot”. In the older parts area presents a somewhat heterogeneous appearance owing to diversity of age and types. New construction, however, has minimized this defect and in newer portions improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are harmonious and of much better quality. While there are a number of multi-family structures they are of the smaller types and are confined to definite sections. This is a medium income area of moderately priced homes. Lot values range from $20 to $25 per front foot and these comparatively low prices have attracted a number of speculative builders. Mortgage institutions report highly satisfactory lending operations here. Proximity to U.C.L.A. and 20th Century Fox Studios, as well as the new Paramount Studio, should insure stability and an upward trend for many years to come. While somewhat spotted in parts the area lies in the path of the community’s growth and is thought to be entitled to a “medial blue” grade.',\n",

This is a multi-automobile area and is only 5 minutes drive to Hollywood where all conveniences are all readily available. This area was subdivided about 15 years ago and shows its greatest period of development during following 5 years. Since its initial activity growth has largely depended upon the specialized demand of those seeking this particular type of neighborhood. The area is characterized by tis winding paved streets with steep grades and confusing locations. Construction and maintenance, while of excellent quality, is exceedingly expensive owing to excessive costs below the sill lines. Architectural designs are generally pleasing and the area is not without charm. Mortgage institutions limit their financing to high margin loans. Size and topography of individual sites govern lot prices. There is a high percentage of home ownership; however, owing to the very limited market forced sales are likely to be made on a basis far below reproduction costs. It can readily be seen that the future of an area such as described is clouded with doubt and it is felt that while it has many of the characteristics of a first grade area, owing to hazards mentioned and risks involved, it should not be accorded better than a “medial blue” grade.',\n",

This area was subdivided about 25 years ago, and developed rapidly under stimulus of promotional effort. While still a good area it has lost much of its earlier popularity. Construction is of good quality and maintenance indicates pride of ownership. Although widely differing in income range, population is of the better class. Improvements are characterized by a wide range in age and architectural designs. The area has experienced quite a little building activity in the past 2 or 3 years largely due to FHA Title II financing. Rental demand is excellent and the trend, particularly in the southern part, is toward income properties. The area is protected from the adverse influence of area D-28 to the west by rugged terrain.

It is one of the oldest parts of Hollywood and was a very popular district at one time. The area is traversed by Highland Ave. and bounded on the east by Cahuenga Blvd. – two heavy traffic arteries – the latter protecting the area from the adverse influence of area D-28 to the east. Construction and maintenance are generally of good quality. Improvements are heterogeneous as to age, size and architectural design. Population, while harmonious, has a wide spread of income, with occupations ranging from better salaried white collar workers to wealthy business and professional men. The topography is uneven and spotted, the central portion is fairy level and balance of area is rolling with steep grades and rugged hills in spots. Proximity to Hollywood Bowl is a detrimental influence. This is an extremely difficult area to grade and there is a wide divergence of opinion among authorities familiar with the district. An attempt to break down the rea resulted in confusion. It is clearly an area where careful individual appraisals should be made. Owing to age and heterogeneity, coupled with a distinct tendency toward multiple-family structures, the area is accorded a “low blue” grade.',\n",

Deed restricted largely to single-family improvements with provision for multiple-family structures in definite locations. Zoning conforms to deed restrictions. Conveniences are all readily available except transportation which is only fairly so; however, this is largely a two-car neighborhood. This area was subdivided some 15 years ago and has experienced a more or less spasmodic development, its greatest activity having been since the advent of FHA financing. Construction is of good quality and maintenance shows pride of ownership. Population is homogeneous and generally economically sound. There is a lack of uniformity in architectural designs and promotional effort on the part of sponsors leaves something to be desired. This undoubtedly accounts for a seeming lack of building progress. Although deed restrictions permit multi-family structures in stated locations, there are as yet comparatively few such improvements. There is a wide variance in size and price of homesites, but values have been quite stable for the past 3 years. There are a few Japanese gardeners in the area but they are not considered permanent residents. Scattered throughout are a number of blocks which could be graded “A”, but the area as a whole is accorded a “high blue” grade.',\n",

Convenience to schools, churches, trading centers and transportation varied, but generally inadequate. Very few streets improved. This area has been subdivided at various intervals during the past 25 years, and growth has been slow. In the past few years, under stimulus of FHA Title II financing, activity has increased considerably. There are some seven hills within the area and improvements are scattered in groups of 10 or more dwellings throughout. The smaller dwellings are usually in the valleys while the more imposing structures occupy the hillside view locations. While some of the improvements are old they are generally of good quality construction with satisfactory maintenance. Population varies greatly and there is very little cohesion between the various small settlements. The area is adjacent to two street car lines, and bus service is also available. Numerous arterials permit quick (10 minute) auto transportation to Los Angeles Civic Center. Climatic conditions are favorable and topography lends itself to view location homesites. With its many favorable influences, and absence of detrimental factors, the area seems ideal for intelligent development. However, present scattered improvements and seemingly favorable possibilities, the area is accorded a provisional hatched “low blue” grade.',\n",

Regardless of zoning, however, the area is preponderantly single-family and pattern is well established. Conveniences are all readily available, including interurban transportation to Los Angeles. Development of this section has been under way in an orderly fashion for a number of years, but it is believed that it has experienced its greatest activity during the past 2 or 3 years under stimulus of FHA Title II financing. Construction runs from standard to extra standard quality; maintenance is of excellent character. Architectural designs are individually attractive and collectively harmonious. Population and improvements are homogeneous. This area stood up particularly well during the depression and rentals continued in demand during this period. Residential lot values range between $20 to $25 per front foot. Due to rental demand a number of large old houses have been converted into rental units and a number of small multiples have been constructed. This area is favorably influenced by other high grade areas in nearby cities to the north. The area is accorded a “medial blue” grade.',\n",

Zoning is mixed; approximately 40% single-family, minimum 5000 sq. ft. per family; 40% duplexes, minimum 2500 sq. ft. per family; 20% larger multi-family, minimum 600 to 1000 sq. ft. per family. Regardless of zoning area is 95% single-family. Conveniences are all readily available including rapid transit to Los Angeles. The western portion from 6th St. and north part from San Marino Ave. were subdivided and is well built up with moderate sized bungalows. The southeast section south of San Marion Ave. and east of 6th St. is the most choice part of area and was put on the market about 10 years ago but developed very slowly until 1937, but has grown rapidly since that time. This is a highly regarded district and, although it is inclined to be heterogeneous both as to population and improvements, it is considered as being still desirable as a place to live. Maintenance, while somewhat spotted, generally indicates pride of occupancy. Owing to its favorable location this is a good rental area. As a consequence a number of small multi-family structures have been built in the western section of area. In 5 years or such a matter this area will probably have to be broken down and part of it given a 3rd grade classification. At present, however, it is deemed reasonable to assign to the area as a whole a “low blue” grade.',\n",

This subdivision was placed on the market by the Los Angeles Investment Co. over 20 years ago, and has shown favorable development. Construction and maintenance is of good standard quality. Architectural designs, uniform setbacks and well improved parking strips give to the area a harmonious aspect. Population is generally homogeneous and exhibits community pride. Multi-family dwellings are quite numerous along Leimert Blvd. and Garthwaite Ave. These are maintained in keeping with other improvements in the district. Lots are usually 40 ft. with values ranging about $15 to $20 per front foot. The area is adjacent to the Crenshaw Blvd. business district. Age and growing obsolescence preclude assigning higher than a “low blue” grade.',\n",

Conveniences are reasonably available. This district was subdivided by Los Angeles Investment Co. something over 10 years ago but was very inactive during the depression. Greatest activity has been during the past 3 years due to FHA Title II financing. Construction ranges from standard to super standard quality. Maintenance is of good character. The area consists of a series of hills and valleys, and improvements on the hillside and top are of better grade and more expensive construction than those in the valleys. Hillside lot values are also higher. These factors account for the wide price spread shown above. Desirability shades off from west to east. Adjacent to the green areas to the north and west are favorable influences. Some of the older structures are over 10 years of age and construction is not of as good quality as later improvements. This, and the difference between hill and valley improvements, detracts from the harmonious appearance of the area. Many blocks in the district would qualify for first grade rating but, taken as a whole, the area does not justify higher than a “medial blue” grade.',\n",

The multi-family dwellings (mostly duplexes) in northern part do not apparently affect desirability. Proximity to parks, country clubs and motion picture studios are favorable influences. The area is accorded “high blue” grade.',\n",

Deed restrictions are said to be loosely drawn but do protect from racial hazards. Schools, churches and trading centers conveniently available and transportation fairly so. This area which is bounded on the north by the Los Angeles River was subdivided some 10 or 15 years ago. Early development was of poor class and activity was at a standstill during depression years. With the advent of FHA financing a revival took place, but it has only been during the past few years that its full stimulus has been felt. During the earlier part of this period it is said that a number of Title I class 3 dwellings were constructed in the eastern part. This type of building has now been discontinued. Much of the earlier construction was substandard with some “Jerry” building but later improvements have been of much better quality. Maintenance is inclined to be spotted, particularly in the eastern part. Better architectural designs have greatly improved the aspect of the area in the past 2 years. Population is inclined to be slightly heterogeneous. This is medium priced home district, which is favorably affected by the adjoining 1st grade area to the south.

Development of this area started some years ago but it remained largely dormant, until some 3 years ago when, under the impetus of FHA Title I and Title II financing, a period of mild activity began. Construction runs from poor substandard to standard quality. FHA loans have been mainly under Title II, although quite a few Title I loans were also built.

The area was more or less dormant for a number of years, but since the advent of FHA Title II financing a moderate amount of building has taken place. Construction ranges from substandard to low grade standard quality. Maintenance is very spotted and is only fair at best. Architectural designs are not appealing, setbacks are not uniform, and single-family improvements are mixed with duplexes and bungalow courts, all of which give the district a crowded and heterogeneous aspect. North of Manchester Blvd. transition to business and income development is noticeable. Regardless of all these derogatory factors the area is a popular one and new improvements of the past several years have done much to tone it up, and it is thought that further decline will be a slow process.

Conveniences are all readily available. Public improvements are of good character. This is an old area and was at one time the best residential section of Inglewood. There are still some original owners in the area whose maintenance shows high pride of ownership, but they are rapidly dwindling. Mortgage institutions report a high percent of repossession and losses during the depression period. The area was dormant until the advent of FHA Title II financing, since which time there has been a number of new modern 5 and 6 room dwellings built, largely along Manchester Ave. Old construction was largely of high standard quality but maintenance, except in cases of original ownership, has been only fair. Conversion of large old single-family dwellings to multiples is noticeable, and encroachment of bungalow courts and other income structures is noteworthy. Proximity to Inglewood Park Cemetery, Hollywood Race Track and small oil field, all to the east, and business expansion along Market St. to the west, are all detrimental influences. New single-family improvements have been too confined to be of any great benefit, and it is thought decline in this area will be rapid. It is therefore accorded a “low yellow” grade.',\n",

Population, improvements and maintenance are all highly heterogeneous. Improvements are practically all single-family frame bungalows. Twenty-six of the new improvements are located south of Imperial between Cherry and Yukon and were financed under FHA Title I. There are many Mexican and Japanese farm laborers in adjacent territory, whose children attend the city schools, and this is considered a detrimental influence. The community is poorly regarded by realtors and mortgage institutions, and many of them will not make commitments there.

Deed restrictions are said to exist and to govern improvements and “setbacks”, and to provide protection against racial hazards. Zoning conforms to deed restrictions. Conveniences are all readily available and schools are outstanding. Public improvements are of good character. This is a typical “company” community, largely owned and control by the Standard Oil Co. of California, which is noted for its employee relation policies. The town’s development was coincident with the building of the modern refinery plant about 25 years ago. Originally, dwellings were largely built and owned by the company but, consistent with the policy of encouraging employees to live near its industrial activities, home ownership has gradually increased. The community suffered but little from “depression ills”, nor has it been greatly influenced by past depression building activity, although it is approved territory for FHA financing. The business district, which contains many establishments owned by nationally known concerns, is a model for neatness and upkeep. Improvements are very generally 4 to 6 room dwellings of good standard construction with high quality maintenance. Architectural designs are pleasing and population is homogeneous. Derogatory influences are adjacency to oil wells, refinery and tank farms. The beach is defiled by a large outfall sewer and oil tanker docks and loading facilities. Owing to detrimental factors named and poor prospects for future growth the area is accorded a “high yellow” grade.',\n",

Development started in this area between 15 and 20 years ago and its growth has been a steady one, with greatly increased activity in the past 3 years, covering both single and multiple family structures, which have been largely financed through FHA loans. Construction is of good standard quality. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy. Architectural designs, particularly of new improvements, including both single and multi-family dwellings, are of appealing character. Population is inclined to be heterogeneous. Location is a logical one. Lot values range from $25 per front foot. Proximity to country clubs and higher grade area are favorable factors. Improvements east of Robertson Blvd. average smaller and older but are still desirable.

The demand for housing attracted many aeronautical workmen and activity in the area increased. FHA financing is available in the area and has much to do with its growing activity. A large part of the holder construction has of substandard quality but recent improvements have been of better character. Maintenance and architectural designs have also improved. Population is nondescript but enjoys higher income than in average workingmen’s district. Price brackets shown above are nominal and do not reflect extra size of homesites, many of which are of acreage proportions.

Conveniences are all available, but with the exception of school and trading center, they are not readily so. This subdivision was placed on the market some 15 years ago, but its greatest activity has been in the last 5 year period largely under stimulus of FHA financing. There has been a great deal of speculative building and this, together with a rather large spread in age, is responsible for the mixed quality of construction, which ranges from substandard plus to standard plus. There is, however, no evidence of “jerry building”. Maintenance is spotted and will average only fair. Both population and improvements are inclined to heterogeneity. Architectural designs of new improvements are of good quality, but such improvements lose much of this appeal by being mixed in with older structures, making a rather inharmonious whole. Lot values are around $18 per front foot. The area is more or less hedged in by business and industry and a large milk distributing plant adjoins it on the north.

This is a well-regarded moderately priced residential section. Construction is of standard quality and maintenance of good character, showing pride of occupancy. Architectural designs are harmonious and “setbacks” are uniform. Population and improvements are generally homogeneous. The location is well adapted for residential purposes. Under stimulus of FHA Title II financing there has been quite a little new construction in the past few years. Proximity to Exposition Park and University of Southern California are distinctly favorable influences. Improvements along 53rd, 54th and 55th Sts. are of poorer quality and have less appeal than balance of district.

The construction of older dwellings is of substandard to “shack” construction. New improvements on the contrary are of good quality and pleasing architectural designs, most of the homes being built with FHA Title II financing. This contradictory condition is responsible for the wide spread shown above. There is also a wide variance in both price range and maintenance. As a natural sequence of the foregoing, population is heterogeneous. Proximity to the S.P. Ry., Grand Central Airport, and industry to the north and west and business to the south are unfavorable factors. Nearness to employment is a favorable influence and current building activity indicates an upward trend. The industrial progress in Burbank and consequent demand for housing is also a constructive influence. After weighing the pros and cons of the situation it is not thought that the recent improvement in this district is stable and the area is therefore accorded a “low yellow” grade.',\n",

Conveniences, including interurban transportation, are all readily available. This area includes the prosperous trading center of Norwalk and its environs, which is one of the older rural communities of the county. While immediate population is probably less than 1000, there is a thickly settled agricultural district to the south and west and numerous small settlements of oil well and refinery employees to the north and east. A state insane asylum adjoins the town on the north and an oil refinery, numerous oil tank farms and the Santa Fe Oil Fields are nearby. Building activity, under stimulus of FHA Title I Class 3 and Title II, has greatly increased in the past several years. Construction ranges from substandard to standard quality, and maintenance, while averaging fair, is very spotted. Population and improvements are highly heterogeneous. While subversive racial elements in the area itself are confined to a few Mexican families on the outskirts, the country districts adjacent are infiltrated with both Mexican and Japanese laborers, credit to a second grade area they are so mixed with less desirable dwellings that it is not feasible to break the area down. Therefore, it is accorded, as a whole, a “low yellow” grade.',\n",

The district suffered severely from foreclosures. However, repossessions sold readily – one institution reports 35 sales during the 1936 and 1937 with none left none left now. This is a workingman’s district and is very popular owing to its favorable location with relation to industry and downtown business districts. Construction is somewhat spotted being generally of a low standard quality. Maintenance is usually of good character. Population and improvements are inclined to heterogeneity. Near Hoover St. and Vermont Ave., which are traffic arteries, are a number of scattered multi-family structures ranging from duplexes and bungalow courts to small apartment houses. The northern and southern tier of blocks are less attractive and of slightly lower grade. The district was formerly subject to flood but is now protected against this threat by an efficient system of drainage. Detrimental features are few and of minor natures.

Deed restricted in parts but provisions loosely drawn; protection against racial hazards believed effective. Zoning largely single-family with limited multi-family in parts. Conveniences are all reasonably available. This area might be termed a health area. It has considerable elevation and is above fog district, and was first developed some 25 years ago as a resort for those suffering from pulmonary ailments. Recently, under stimulus of FHA financing, many new residences of suburban character have been constructed, but it is still viewed as a “health” section and a number of sanitariums and small cottages for the treatment of tubercular disease are found in the “hatched” portion. Construction ranges from standard to substandard quality and maintenance averages only “fair”. Population and improvements are extremely heterogeneous. This characteristic is even more apparent in the hatched portion of the area where land development averages less than 10% and improvements range from shacks to mansion and estate type structures in the foothills. It is difficult to predict the future desirability of an area of this character; it will probably remain as it is now, a “low yellow” grade.',\n",

Where they existed, have expired except for provision protecting against racial hazards. Zoning is mixed, but in Los Angeles City territory is generally limited to single and four family residential. In country territory zoning is inadequate. Regardless of zoning, improvements are 90% single family dwellings. Conveniences are all available in varying degrees. Some street improvements and sewers are lacking in southern portion. This large far flung district varies in age from 25 years or more between Slauson and Florence Avenues to new development from Imperial Highway to Los Angeles County line. There are many old structures scattered throughout which give the area a spotted and heterogeneous aspect. There are many blocks, however, which are uniform as to southwestern part where pattern has not been definitely established. There were many foreclosures in this area during the depression period and the HOLC Veterans’ Welfare Board and other large mortgage institutions at one time owned a large amount of acquirements. These have now, however, been largely liquidated. The area is predominantly workingman’s district and there are numerous duplexes, four family flats and bungalow courts scattered throughout. There is a threat of subversive racial infiltration (Negroes largely) in the southeast portion of area. An attempt was made to break this area down, but it is in a transition period at present, and it was not feasible. However, it is believed that in the course of time it will be necessary that this be done and will result in a number of areas grading from “low blue” to 4th grade. A large amount of FHA financing has recently taken place in the area and has had the effect of greatly increasing home ownership and strengthening its grade. Much of the southwest portion of the area occupies County territory which further confuses the situation. Construction ranges from low to good standard quality. Maintenance is generally fair. Both population and improvements, however, are heterogeneous. There are no major detrimental influences, and taken by and large the area will grade “low yellow” throughout.',\n",

This rather far flung area is partially located in unincorporated County territory and in the three incorporated towns of Huntington Park, Maywood and Bell, zoning there is highly heterogeneous. Conveniences are all reasonably or readily available according to location. Originally developed some 25 years ago as a workingman’s residential district it has maintained this characteristic and its population is largely composed of workmen employed in the many adjacent industrial districts. Building activity has increased moderately during the past several years under the stimulus of FHA financing but there has been very little speculative building. Construction is of fair standard quality throughout, with but little, if any, “Jerry” building. Maintenance is somewhat spotted but generally reflects pride of occupancy. Population is predominantly of the lower income group. Improvements, while varying greatly as to age, are uniform as to type and size. Scattered throughout the district area number of duplexes, quadruplexes, bungalow court and small apartment houses. A high voltage power line crosses the area and is a detrimental influence, 6 arterial highways constitute traffic hazards. The area is accorded a “low yellow” grade.',\n",

Zoning is mixed but pattern of area is definitely single family residential. Conveniences are all available but transportation is inadequate. Many streets are unimproved and sewers are lacking in outlying sections. This area embraces portions of both Southgate and Lynwood and was developed between 15 and 20 years ago as a workingman’s district. Growth was retarded by overlapping Ad Valorem tax districts but these were largely adjusted during the early part of 1938, and since that time between 300 and 400 homes have been erected, largely through the aid of FHA financing. Construction of older dwellings is more or less substandard, but new construction is generally standard quality. Maintenance is spotted but usually of fair character. Both population and improvements are heterogeneous. The Capital Company recently started to develop a large subdivision between Atlantic Blvd. and Otis Ave., north of Tweedy and Abbott Road. The few improvements completed indicate that this section may in time qualify for a second grade area.

Zoning is mixed but is preponderantly single family residential. Conveniences are all available but not readily so and transportation is inadequate. Many streets unimproved and sewers are very generally lacking. This low income workingman’s district has been under development for the past 12 or 15 years. Growth has been greatly retarded by overlapping Ad valorem tax districts. Much of the area has now been cleared of these but not all. This favorable development, coupled with several large industries moving into the neighborhood and the stimulus of FHA Title I Class 3 and Title II financing, has had the effect of greatly increasing building activity. Construction varies widely ranging from “Jerry built” substandard largely financed with FHA Title I Class 3 loans to fair standard quality financed with FHA Title II insured mortgages. The better quality construction being largely in the western part. Maintenance shows but little pride of occupancy, and population is inclined to be heterogeneous. The pattern of the area is far from definite and with the complete clearing of the Ad Valorem tax situation the area may emerge from the present unsettled condition, which has prevailed for the past decade, to achieve a higher grade than the “low yellow” assigned at this time.',\n",

Conveniences are all fairly available. This area has developed from an early beginning as a summer semi-mountain resort and has developed slowly during the past 25 years to a year-round residential neighborhood. Flood hazards were formerly a distinct retardant but, with commencement of a permanent flood control program in 1935, fear of this menace has subsides and remains largely as a mental unfavorable influence. Under the stimulus of FHA financing and its glen-like charm the area has experienced a district upward trend during the past several years. With the background outlined it can be readily seen that improvements, population and maintenance, while greatly improved, are still very heterogeneous in character. Conflicting influences make it extremely difficult to predict the future trend of this area. The heavy rainfall and many floods of last years affected this district adversely. Natural charm and conveniences to Glendale Junior College are favorable influences offsetting to some extent the negative factors indicated. Despite the popularity attained by the area in 1937 it is felt that it reached its peak at that time and that it will experience an off-setting decline which will continue. It is therefore accorded a “low yellow” grade,',\n",

Set backs are uniform and architectural designs are harmonious. Population within the area is homogeneous, but the surrounding country contains many Japanese truck gardeners and Mexican farm laborer families whose children attend the local schools. Proximity to oil fields on two sides, while not close, is considered an adverse influence. Lot values range from $10 to $15 per front foot.

Some street improvements are not up to standard. Lack of trunk sewers west of Long Beach Blvd. is also a matter of note. This area has been developing for the past 15 years, but its greatest activity has been within past few years due to FHA Title II financing. That part of area west of Atlantic Blvd. is older and has some two story dwellings and multi-family structures, the latter being confined to the north with which part of it would have been included except for its close proximity to oil well development to south. New improvements have bene largely confined to part east of Atlantic Blvd. Construction is of standard quality and maintenance is of good character. Architectural designs of new improvements are attractive, but development of western part south of 37th St. is somewhat heterogeneous. Lot values range from $15 to $20 per front foot and are said to be stable at those figures. While proximity to oil well development is seemingly not a deterrent they are thought to be a subversive influence and the area is therefore accorded a “medial yellow” grade.',\n",

Zoning follows deed restrictions. Conveniences are all readily available, including interurban service to Los Angeles. Local transportation is by bus lines. This district was subdivided and placed on the market over 10 years ago by Wm. H. Wrigley, Jr., of chewing gum fame. Development was very rapid but dwindled to dormancy during the depression years. With the advent of FHA Title II financing, however, activity was resumed, and it has been a “hot spot” during the past few years. Construction is of standard quality and maintenance is of good character. Population is homogeneous and community pride is evident. About 10% of the improvements consist of residential income structures located in accord with tract dedication. Architectural designs of these structures harmonize with the single family dwellings are occupied by the same class of people. Threat of flood from adjacent Los Angeles River, odors from Signal Hill and Wilmington oil fields and proximity to lower grade and industrial areas to the west and northwest, are detrimental influences, which lead to the conclusion that the area is declining and is a misplaced development.

Zoning is mixed single and multi-family with business permitted along numerous thoroughfares. Conveniences are all readily available. This is one of the older residential sections of Long Beach and much of its development took place during the boom period of the early 20’s. Construction during period was generally of substandard quality and much of it was of the “Jerry built” variety. As a result of this the area presents a heterogeneous aspect. This is particularly true of that part west of Redondo Ave. The eastern part is newer and somewhat better grade. However, the whole area is spotted and is slowly trending to income properties. Lot values range from $20 to $100 per front foot, prices depreciating noticeably going north. New construction is of standard quality and maintenance in general is of fair character. Population, while not homogeneous, is generally stable. There are many multiple family structures in the area, mostly of medium quality, which cater to the tourist trade. While this area is declining, it will be many years before it becomes generally blighted. It is therefore thought entitled to a “medial yellow” grade.',\n",

This subdivision was platted and placed on the market in the late 20’s. The area was quite active until drilling for oil started near its eastern border in 1938. This resulted in lowered values. It is said that in the very recent past the well which was being drilled “came in dry”. When this fact becomes known it will undoubtedly affect the area. There is also a small oil field southeast of the area but this is said not to be a deterring factor. Proximity to Recreation Park is thought to be a detrimental to immediately adjacent property on account of Sunday crowds, but a favorable influence to balance of area. Construction and maintenance are of medium quality. Population and improvements give the impression of being somewhat heterogeneous.

Schools, churches and trading centers are reasonably available. Parts of this area were platted some 20 years ago but major portion of development has taken place within recent years. This is a low income workingman’s district and both age and construction of improvements are of a heterogeneous nature. Within the past two years two subdivisions of FHA Title I homes have been started in the area, one north of Rosecrans between Stoneacre St. and Pacific Ave., where 100 homes are completed or under construction. The other is located east of Wright Rd. south of Clark St., where 50 or more new homes are in process of construction. The construction of these Title I homes is substandard and many of them are “Jerry built” in addition. Owing to the low income of the population, the heterogeneous character of the older improvements and the poor quality of construction of the new improvements, it is not felt higher than a “medial yellow” grade is warranted.',\n",

There are comparatively few multi-family dwellings but a distinct tendency to build rental units behind dwellings (on rear of lots). While there are no known subversive racial elements, the population is very heterogeneous, income levels being quite diverse.

Development of this area along the beach began some 35 or 40 years ago, and has proceeded slowly since, the past two or three years having been the period of its greatest activity. This is considered the most popular and appealing beach resort in the vicinity of Los Angeles. Construction varies from “shack” to standard quality, new improvements being of very much better character. Maintenance is spotted but averages better than in most beach resorts. As is usual in this type of community the population is heterogeneous. The multiple family structures are generally of poor quality and lacking in appeal. The 30 foot lots which prevail in the area give it a crowded aspect. The area is accorded a “medial yellow” grade/',\n",

Deed restrictions generally limit improvements to single family dwellings and protect against racial hazards. Conveniences are available along Pico Boulevard and along Lincoln Boulevard at west but remainder of area is far removed from such conveniences. Transportation is available by bus and Pacific Electric Railway to Los Angeles via Culver City but inadequate and expensive. This area was only sparsely improved until quite recently when FHA financing stimulated building in the area. Most of this new activity has been concentrated around the rapidly expanding Douglas Aircraft Corporation, both north and south of Pico Blvd. and in the southwest corner of the area on the hillside streets of Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, Sunset and Robson Streets. The area north of Pico was formerly zoned in industrial frontage but has been re-zoned and is now approved for FHA policy to mix Title I and Title II construction. The sparseness of development, the general sub-standard quality of construction, particularly among the older improvements, the heterogeneousness of development and the absence of conveniences and adequate transportation preclude other than a medial “C” grade for the area.

Construction varies from standard to substandard with some “Jerry built” dwellings. Mixed types, architectural designs, age and obsolescence give the area a somewhat heterogeneous appearance. Population is generally homogeneous and maintenance shows pride of occupancy. Accessibility of location and rising land values indicates a trend toward multi-family structures.

There are no deed restrictions and zoning is mixed but largely single-family residential with spotted zoning for multiple-family structures throughout. Conveniences are generally all readily available. This is one of the older parts of Los Angeles and has been developed in a very haphazard manner. It is so extremely spotted that it is impossible to describe the area and present a clear picture of it. Construction ranges from standard to substandard with some “Jerry building”. Maintenance in general is fair with pride of occupancy being indicated in many instances. There is a wide spread in age of improvements, old and new dwellings being mixed throughout and in some districts spotted with residential income properties. Obsolescence is observed in most parts of the area. North and west of Occidental College and adjacent to it is a small district of large old dwellings of more imposing character, but age and obsolescence preclude a higher grade than that assigned to the area as a whole. Location, accessibility and proximity to Occidental College are favorable influences. Taking it all in all the chief characteristic of this nondescript area is heterogeneity, and this applies alike to population, improvements, terrain and state of repair. The area is a large one and in time some of the districts, which are least improved at present, may rate a higher grade.

Construction, while differing widely in size, age and designs, is generally of standard quality. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy and population, which includes many public employees, is generally homogeneous. Proximity to Forest Lawn Cemetery adversely affects adjacent property. The area has no particular appeal. Its location makes it easily accessible from downtown Los Angeles and it is thought that its future trend may be toward multiple-family structures.

Water is furnished by a mutual water system belonging to owners of record. This district was originally a section of small lemon and orange groves. In the early 20’s some of these located between Fairoaks and Olive Aves. And Mariposa and Palm Streets were subdivided by Janss Construction Co., who were sold upon a second mortgage basis in a “ballyhoo” campaign. These improvements depreciated very rapidly and have given this particular section a “shopworn” appearance and the whole area a bad reputation. During the past several years, under the stimulus of FHA Title II financing, several subdivisions in the northern part of the area have bene placed upon the market. Probably 150 of these 5 and 6 room dwellings have been constructed since 1936 and have greatly improved the aspect of the whole area. It is difficult to predict the future trend of this area, but it is felt that a provisional grade of “medial yellow” is warranted.',\n",

Deed restrictions as to character of improvements have generally expired but racial restrictions in many cases are still in force. Zoning is mixed: 5/8 single-family residential; 2/8 permits duplexes; and 1/8 commercial. Regardless of zoning, however, area is preponderantly single-family residential and pattern is definitely established. Conveniences are all readily available. This section was subdivided many years ago and was a very popular district 20 years ago and is still highly regarded. Many of the large old residences are still occupied by original owners, who are people of means. Construction is generally super standard and quality of maintenance is excellent. In fact, this is a chief characteristic of the area. Architectural designs are representative of many periods and consequently lack harmony and give the area a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Population is generally substantial, although not altogether homogeneous in character. While the percent of land improvement is high this is somewhat on account of the high average size of homesites, which are usually well kept. In the structures which undoubtedly indicates the general future tendency of the area as a whole. While this district has been “definitely declining” for a number of years the process has been a very gradual one and present indications are that this trend will continue indefinitely.

Many original owners still occupy there residences. The Vista del Arroyo Hotel, an all year around resort, occupies the block on the west side of Grand Ave. from Colorado to Ellis St. A number of apartment houses and bungalows are operated in connection with this hotel. The area has been definitely declining for a number of years and is slowly trending to residential income structures.

While there are still many owner occupied dwellings it is rapidly losing its desirability as a single-family residential district, and “best use” is rapidly running to residential income structures. It is one of the best rental areas in the city and 20% of structures are already of this type. These, however, are all located in the northern part of the area and consist of medium grade small apartment houses, bungalow courts, 4-family flats and old residences converted to multi-family use. Improvements are heterogeneous as to age, type, size and maintenance. Population is mixed both as to incomes and social levels. The southern part of area largely on account of zoning will, it is thought, have a prolonged period of decline, and some part of it might be assigned a higher grade.

Maintenance is spotted and only fair at best. Although adjacent to Pasadena, it is separated from it by a range of low vacant hills and is within the city limits of Los Angeles. New construction in the area was largely along avenues 63, 64, 65 and northern part of Ave. 66, which constitutes the best part of the area.

Deed restrictions limit improvements to minimum cost of $3500 provides for architectural supervision and racial protection. Zoning permits single-family and duplexes, but there is only single-family at present. Conveniences are all readily available, including cheap rapid transit of Los Angeles City Center. This is a new subdivision recently placed on the market by the Huntington Land and Improvement Co., who originally purchased it for a short interurban route from Pasadena to Los Angeles. This route was discarded and it lay dormant as a swampy tract until it was included in a WPA project, cleared and drained. (How this was accomplished was not researched). After this improvement the area was platted and placed upon the market as a high grade “commuters” subdivision. Under the stimulus of promotional effort and FHA Title II financing, great progress has been made in its development. Construction runs from standard or better grade. Architectural designs are individually attractive and harmonious as a whole. Population bids fair to be homogeneous. Owing to the convenience of the location to the new Los Angeles City Civic Center the area is a popular one City, County, State and Federal employees. Land values are not stabilized but run from $10 to $15 per front foot. Because of the speculative nature of the enterprise and low ownership equity provided by FHA financing, coupled with the fact that it is engulfed by an old district of lower grade (El Sereto), it is thought that this area has already passed its peak of desirability and is therefore accorded a “high yellow” grade.',\n",

New construction which is generally of good quality is largely in four district: between Minto and Thelma near Huntington Drive; Chadwick and Templeton St.; Lombardy Ave. along Endicott near Ithaca, and along the winding hillside streets on the south slopes of the hills to the south of Valle Blvd. This development indicates that in time this area should be broken down and regarded.

Deed restrictions designate types of improvements, provide uniform setbacks, and protection from subversive racial elements. Conveniences are all reasonably and readily available. Some dead end streets. Many poorly and cheaply constructed street improvements. Part of this district was originally subdivided a number of years ago, but was far from successful. During the past 4 years under the stimulus of FHA Title I and Title II financing a number of speculative builders have operated in the area and it has been considered one of the community “hot spots”. Constructive ranges from substandard to standard quality. Architectural designs are individually attractive and usually harmonious as a whole. Population is inclined to be heterogeneous, and while owner occupancy is high, equities average so low as to threaten the economic stability of the area. Practically all improvements are being constructed by speculative builders whose profits are said to be largely derived from arbitrary increase in land prices. Sales are being effected by “high pressure” methods and there is evidence of increasing sales resistance, as many completed dwellings remain unsold. The section east of San Gabriel Blvd. appears to be the most promising part of the area. The section lying north of Chestnut Ave. west of Del Mar St., known as San Gabriel Village, adjoins a low-grade Mexican section and is engulfed by it on three sides and in addition is in proximity to the Pasadena Sewer Farm. This ambitious project is sponsored by Percy Bilton, Inc., which is aid to be financed with English capital. Informed sources very generally consider this a misplaced investment that is doomed to failure. Although most of the improvements are new and fairly well constructed, when the location, character of population, lack of appeal, and large number of completed dwellings remaining unsold are taken into consideration, it is not deemed wise to assign to the are higher than a “medial yellow” grade.',\n",

Schools, churches and trading centers are readily available. Local transportation facilities are inadequate but interurban service to Pasadena and Los Angeles is ample. This area is some 25 to 30 years old, and its development has been gradual, and largely without direction. Numerous acreage tracts scattered throughout are devoted to citrus groves and poultry raising. FHA financing has stimulated building and the past five years have been the most active in the area’s history. Improvements are heterogeneous as to age, type and construction. Maintenance is generally of good character and indicates pride of occupancy. Although there is a wide spread in income, population is largely homogeneous. New construction is of good quality and architectural designs are attractive. The location of the area south of Huntington Blvd. and its proximity to Santa Anita Park and race track is a favorable influence. Price brackets shown above are nominal only, as size of homesites vary greatly and are a material price factor. All things considered it is felt that the area is entitled to a “high yellow” grade.',\n",

Deed restriction shave expired and zoning is mixed; however, area is predominantly single-family residential. Conveniences are available but not readily so. Sewers are lacking and a majority of the streets are not yet platted. The area is some 30 years old and was developed as an orchard district. It has gradually grown into a sustenance homestead section, with lands selling from $1000 to $1500 per acre. There are few, if any, homesites of less than ½ acre. Scattered throughout are numerous poultry farms, citrus and walnut groves of various sizes. While price ranges are not feasible, nominal values run from $1800 for an 18-year old 3-room cottage and ½ acre to $6000 for an 18-year old 8-room 2-story residence and ½ acre of land. Needless to say population, improvements, age, architectural styles, construction and maintenance are all of a heterogeneous nature. New construction, which is largely confined to the district west of Second Avenue and south of Valnett Avenue is of good quality, having, with the few exceptions, been financed with FHA Title II loans and built under FHA supervision. While the area has many detrimental factors, the volume of new and better improvements seem to warrant assigning a “medial yellow” grade,',\n",

Flood Control Board now working to eliminate flood threat in southwest portion land improved 40% including citrus groves as part of homesites. This area consist of an unincorporated community known as Temple City, which has slowly developed over the past 25 or 30 years. Under the stimulus of FHA financing and the elimination of a “Mattoon Bonded Dept.” it has had its period of greatest activity within the past few years. There are many poultry farms, citrus and walnut groves of varying sizes scattered throughout the area. Population, improvements, age, architectural designs, maintenance and quality of construction are all of a heterogeneous character. New construction, which is largely under FHA supervision, has been in considerable volume and has bettered grade of area and increased its desirability. The small section of this area lying to the west of San Gabriel Blvd. is of slightly better quality, being developed in small homesites interspersed with citrus groves, but this small neighborhood suffers from dead-end streets to the west and the hazard of the high-speed traffic artery, San Gabriel Blvd. to the east. However, it is not thought feasible to accord better than a “medial yellow” grade.',\n",

Being under County government only zoning restriction limits to minimum of 5,000 sq. ft. land occupied by single family. Conveniences are all available but not conveniently so. This area is the newer part of El Monte and has been developed within the past 10 years. Several years ago a U.S. Housing authority low-cost housing project consisting of about 200 small single family dwellings were located here. This is a secluded area with well laid out and shaded streets, which add charm to the neighborhood. The area was originally developed under high pressure promotional efforts and construction is very largely of substandard character. Newer construction, however, is of better grade and maintenance indicates pride of occupancy. Population is homogeneous as to type and architectural designs are fairly uniform. The low tax rate shown is a favorable factor but lack of deed restrictions and proper zoning is a detrimental influence. Owing to poor location and substandard construction it is not thought that higher than a “medial yellow” grade is justified.',\n",

Parts of that section between Van Nuys Blvd. and Hazeltine Ave. have heretofore been subject to floods from the Tyrone Wash, but this danger will be minimized it is stated upon completion of flood control project now under construction. Land improved 70%. Deed restrictions are said to have expired. Zoning limits improvements to residential structures, largely single-family. Conveniences are all readily available. For background of area see description of B-2. This is the older section of Van Nuys and is heterogeneous as to population, improvements and maintenance. During the 1938 floods the section described above was subject to serious damage and it is practically impossible to secure financing in that part. The improvements along Hayes, Hamlin and Gilmore Sts. east of Hazeltine Ave. are outside of flood district, are new and of much better character than balance of area. On the theory that the flood hazard in the area has been mitigated, it is accorded a provisional “medial yellow” grade. Terrain: Level. No construction hazards. Flood threat remote. Land improved 80%. Unincorporated community under County government and zoning is inadequate. Pattern of area, however, is well established and is predominantly single-family. Conveniences are all readily available. This is the oldest and best residential section of El Monte and has been slowly developing over the past 25 or 30 years. Construction is generally of standard quality and maintenance indicates pride of occupancy. Population is homogeneous. Streets are well-shaded and improved. While improvements differ widely as to age and design they are generally harmonious.  Proximity to the “red” area to the northwest and lack of deed and zoning protection are the most detrimental influences. The area is definitely declining and it is not thought that better than a “medial yellow” grade is warranted.',\n",

The town is over 40 years old and is the center of rich citrus orchard section. Citrus land ranging from $500 to $600 with fully improved groves selling around $1000 per acre. Lot values run $10 to $15 per front foot. Improvements range from new to 40 years and are naturally heterogeneous as to ages, types and sizes. Population is that of a farm community and is generally harmonious. Construction and maintenance is predominantly of good character. There has been quite a little new construction during the past few years, the bulk of it being in the northern part above Foothill Blvd. The area, although spotted throughout, grades generally from “low yellow” in the southern part to “high yellow” in the northwest section.

In addition to the single family residences mentioned above there are several bungalow courts, small apartment houses, fraternity houses, lodging and boarding houses in the area. Construction is usually of standard quality. Maintenance, while inclined to be spotted, is generally of good character. Population is homogeneous and highly cultural. Streets are wide, well improved and landscaped which adds charm to the location. This area has many of the attributes of a second grade district including a high degree of stability. However, owing to the heterogeneous types of improvements, and wide spread in ages, it is thought that a “high yellow” grade more nearly conforms to its characteristics.',\n",

This is the old section of Pomona and is over 60 years old, and many former residents have moved into newer districts, and this exodus is still continuing. The average age of dwellings has been considerably lowered by volume of new construction which has taken place in the past several years. These new improvements are of modern designs but construction is inclined to be substandard. Both population and improvements are extremely heterogeneous. Land values range from $10 to $15 per front foot and property values seem inclined to hold up remarkably for an area of this type. The infiltration of Mexican families is confined to a small section in the extreme western part and is not thought to be serious nor is it believed that it will extend further. The area is declining very slowly and this factor together with the continuing volume of new construction is responsible for according a “medial yellow” grade.',\n",

It is largely surrounded by business, industry and Mexican and Negro districts. Construction is quite generally substandard and maintenance is spotted and only fair at best. Both population and improvements are extremely heterogeneous. A new subdivision is being attempted on 5th and 6th Sts. west of Myrtle and about 20 new improvements built during the past years. Local realtors express the opinion that this is a misplaced development. The few Mexicans and Negro families are largely adjacent to the “red” area west and south and is said not to be a threat to the greatest part of this area.

This area, which is composed of Rustic and Santa Monica Canyons, began to develop between 17 and 25 years ago. It has grown like “Topsy” with but little, if any, directional supervision. During past few years a better type of improvement has been noted. Improvements and construction are highly heterogeneous. Maintenance, however, is generally of better quality than might be expected and indicates a pride of occupancy. Population is of mixed character. The average front foot value of lots is around $30. There is a certain charm in the location of this area and the combination of mountain and seashore atmosphere is attractive to many people. There is evidence of an upward trend in the area, which might be termed the renaissance of a beach resort or summer colony neighborhood.

Development was slow during its earlier years, but it was a “hot spot” in the early 20’s and there has been some activity during past 5 years. Since deed restrictions expired the trend has been to multi-family structures. Construction of single-family dwellings has been quite generally of standard quality but many of the multiple family structures are said to be poorly built. Maintenance is spotted but in general shows fair pride of occupancy. This is a popular rental district and inclined to be seasonal in character. The rentals shown are nominal and based upon average prices. The area is slowly declining, but land values, which are currently around $30 per front foot, are rising and are partially offsetting depreciation and obsolescence.

During the past 3 years, under the promotional stimulus of speculative builders and FHA Title II financing, there has been quite a little building activity of much better character. However, the mixed old and new construction gives the area a heterogeneous aspect. There is a high percent of owner occupancy and maintenance indicates pride of ownership.

The Japs in the area operate leased garden tracts, and as development takes place they are being pushed out. There are quite a number of third generation Mexican land owners who leased to Jap gardeners. These are pretty generally staying in district and may prove of sufficient influence to adversely affect area. New improvements, however, indicate a “low yellow” development.

There are no deeds restrictions nor zoning; however, are terrain and isolation protective elements. Transportation limited to private automobiles. Free bus service to public schools. Churches, trading and amusement centers are remote, the nearest being Westwood Village. Originally opened up some 14 or 16 years ago as a small “cabin” type project. This area has improved considerably in the past few years and new construction is now more pretentious and of much better quality. In consequence the area is extremely heterogeneous, improvements varying from two-room cabins and shacks to new modern 6 and 7 room bungalows. There are very few improved streets and the majority shown on the map are non-existent and are topographically impossible. Platting has been largely arbitrary, contours being followed as improvements were made. In this respect lack of restrictions has been a decided detriment. Beverly Glen Blvd., the principal thoroughfare, is a through trunk highway, and well-traveled, but is narrow and winding with a number of steep grades. Lot values run from $500 to $650. Realtors state that competition of FHA Title I financing has adversely affected both price and rental values. This area, in common with other canyon developments, faces the hazards of fire, floods and steep grades. Ample forestation, coupled with rustic scenic beauty, lend charm to the neighborhood. These natural advantages, together with prospect of a favorable development of adjacent mountainous section, constitute elements distinctly favorable to the future of the area. Under the circumstances it is felt that only a “provisional yellow” grade should be accorded.',\n",

This comparatively new area comprises one of the real estate tragedies of Los Angeles. It was placed upon the market some 5 years ago as a high class subdivisions and under the stimulus of a well-planned promotional effort developed rapidly. At the heyday of its activity, came the floods of 1938 and almost overnight devastated the district and, at least temporarily, blighted its future. Trapped between two major washes it suffered severely and, while actual damages to improvements were comparatively slight, grounds were washed out, in some cases practically to the front door steps of the residences, bring terror to the inmates. Much control work has been done since and it is believed that the flood danger has been largely overcome. However, the mental hazard remains and will continue until another flood season tests the efficiency of the flood control projects. Construction is of the highest character and architectural designs are works of art. Population is homogeneous and maintenance shows high pride of ownership. The location, in addition to ready accessibility, is heavily wooded and has great natural charm. It is thought possible that the area will experience a renaissance, but under present conditions a provisional “yellow” grade is all that is justified.',\n",

Owing to fact that this area is largely in county territory, there is little zoning protection. The small district north of Hollywood Dr., east Hancock, offers limited deed protection which is enforced. Conveniences are all readily available. This is one of the oldest sections of West Hollywood, development having begun over 25 years ago. In the northern part of the area, the older bungalows on semi-hillside lots are being replaced by newer and more pretentious improvements. Generally, the area was developed by speculative buyers and construction is of an inferior quality. Maintenance, however, is of a good character.

However, the pattern of the area is quite well established and its proximity to Beverly Hills will undoubtedly continue to be a stabilizing influence. In fact, the indications are that this stimulus is tending toward an upward trend in grade. While the area is predominantly single family in its make-up, there has been some encroachment of cheaper class duplexes and four family flats. Improvements are of fair character but some inclined to be heterogeneous which is also true of the population. There is an inclination to be heterogeneous which is also true of the population. There is an inclination toward overcrowding and there are many cases where two bungalows will be found on one lot. Lot values run from $20 to $25 per front foot and are said to be in good demand which is also true of rentals. Lending institutions report favorably experience in the area. Owing to lack of deed or zoning protection, its proximity to a lower grade area to the east and business district to the south, it is felt that the area should not be accorded higher than a “low C” grade.',\n",

Lately, however, improvements have run quite strongly to multi-family construction and there are quite a few large apartment houses in the area. The best of these are on Havenhurst and Crescent Heights and are of Class A construction. While many of the old homes are highly maintained and are still in original ownership, the trend of the area is definitely toward residential income property with a threat of business encroachment in the course of time. Lot values are from $40 to $50 per front foot which militates against single family construction in an area of this character. Realtors state that FHA financing is having the effect of lowering rental values which is very noticeable in this area.

It is one of the oldest sections of Hollywood and the trend is quite decidedly toward residential income properties. Many sections of the area are entirely built up with 5 and 7 room bungalows which are well constructed and maintained. This is particularly true in the northwest section. Mortgage lenders report an unfavorable lending experience in this district with a number of foreclosures upon which losses were taken. It will be noted that the P.E. Ry. Runs diagonally thru the area and while this adds to transportation conveniences, it is said to be distinctly detrimental so far as sales are concerned.

Development of this area began some 15 or 20 years ago and there are a number of homes in the northern part along Bloomfield St. and Valley Spring Road which are 15 or more years old and are showing a downward tendency. This is also true in the part south of Ventura Blvd. The floods of 1938 did real damage to the newest and best part of the district, lying between Victory Wash and the Los Angeles River. Part of this district is still more or less isolated on account of washed out bridges which have not yet been replaced. The best part of area includes Brooks View Drive and Bluffside Drive and intermediate thoroughfares. Construction in this section is new and of excellent quality, with harmonious architectural designs. Prior to the floods of 1938 this particular portion would probably have rated first grade. However, physical damage and mental hazard which it caused has seriously affected the area’s desirability, and, while it may come back owing to its excellent location and flood control work that is being done, under existing conditions a provisional “yellow” grade is all that seems justified.',\n",

The section between Santa Monica Blvd. and Willoughby Ave. is older and most of the new construction has been in the southern part of the district. Most of the new multi-family construction is in this part. Average lot values run around $30 per front foot. The type of construction is generally good and development has been fairly uniform.

Deed restrictions, which are far from adequate, are rapidly expiring and zoning permits multiple family housing in many parts of area. Conveniences are all readily available. This area is one of the older parts of Hollywood proper and was subdivided some 20 years or more ago. It has since been built up with 5, 6 and 7 room dwellings. Since deed restrictions began to expire the trend has been strongly to multiple family dwellings; in fact, single family dwellings in this area are considered an under-improvement. From Sunset Blvd. south to Fountain Ave. between Wilcox Blvd. and Highland Ave. there is a strong Catholic concentration which favorably influences prices and demand in that neighborhood. Proximity to industry on the south and business on the north while decreasing desirability of single family dwellings, has a stimulating effect on land values. Adjacence to the center of the growing radio broadcasting industry has been a favorable factor, particularly upon rentals. Construction is of good quality and maintenance, while somewhat spotted, is generally good. Improvements as a whole are inharmonious. Population is inclined to be heterogeneous, (15% being American born Jews) with indications of increasing number of lower class residents.

Maintenance is very spotted, being fair to good west of Las Palmas Ave. and poor to fair in balance of area. This, together with wide range in age of improvements, gives the area a heterogeneous aspect. Population, 15 to 20% of which are Jewish, is inharmonious and indications are that it will become more so. While there are comparatively few multiple family structures, the area being preponderantly single family dwellings, the trend is toward that type of improvement. In fact, with lot values around $40 per front foot, construction of 5 and 6 room cottages is hardly practical, even at prevailing high rentals. This rental situation has been largely the result of increasing employment in the motion picture and broadcasting studios located in close proximity to the area.

Deed restrictions permit multiple-family structures and protect against subversive racial elements. Zoning is multi-family residential. Conveniences of highest quality are all readily available. This area was subdivided about 18 years ago and has developed into one of the best and most popular multi-family districts in the city. The predominant type of improvement is duplexes generally of 7 to 8 room units and quadruplexes of 5-room units. Construction and maintenance are of excellent character and architectural designs are harmonious. Population is of the upper medium income group, approximately 20% of which are Jewish families. The southern half is considered more desirable and commands better rentals than the northern part. This is probably on account of its proximity to the widely known “Miracle Mile” trading area along Wilshire Blvd. Land values are firm and vacant lots have sold as high as $100 per front foot. The apartment houses in the area are largely located in the southwest part. The block east of La Brea Ave. between 2nd and 3rd Sts., which has long been occupied by a horticultural nursery, is now in process of being subdivided. Deed restrictions have not as yet been disclosed. This area, if judged from the standpoint of desirability as a multi-family residential district, would be given a high blue grade, but as a single family area it is accorded a “high yellow” grade.',\n",

Originally a single-family district the present trend is distinctly toward residential income properties of various types and sizes. Construction varies from standard to “jerry built” and maintenance, while generally fair in quality, is spotted. Improvements are heterogeneous in character ranging from single story bungalows to old 8 and 10 room dwellings and multi-family structures. West of Gramercy Place in southern part homes are uniformly large and outmoded but fairly maintained and largely owner occupied. Population is much more homogeneous than varying types of improvement would indicate.

This area was subdivided some 23 years ago to provide homes for people of modest means who desired close-in hillside properties. The area was popular during the building boom of the middle 20’s and developed rapidly. Construction is generally good and maintenance, while spotted, is fair. Architectural designs are unattractive, being largely of the flat roof box design. Most of the streets are narrow and winding, many of them terminating at the crest of the bluff on the northern boundary. The population is said to be homogeneous. There are a number of multi-family dwellings in the lower parts of the area. While there has been building activity since the advent of FHA financing, the area is definitely declining and, as more attractive locations of similar character are now available, it is not believed that a grade higher than “medial yellow” is warranted.',\n",

It was more or less static for a number of years but has recently experienced renewed activity. Improvements are principally modest single family dwellings, but there are a number of small apartment houses, bungalow courts and multi-family dwellings largely along Echo Park Ave. The mixture of old and new construction causes a wide range in age and architectural types and gives the district a heterogeneous aspect. While maintenance is of fair quality, obsolescence is nevertheless quite noticeable. Population is largely native born Russians of American parentage with but little probability of subversive infiltration. Recent new construction has been of substantial amount and distinctly better quality and design, and indicates an upward trend; and, for this reason, the area is accorded a “low yellow” grade.',\n",

Deed restrictions are expiring and zoning varies from single-family to unlimited residential. Conveniences are all readily available. This area comprises several subdivision which were placed upon the market from 1904 to 1910 and developed into part of Los Angeles’ most exclusive residential district. Owing to its very favorable location, when deed restrictions began to expire some 10 years ago, multi-family structures began to appear. The transition from an exclusive single-family neighborhood to a residential income district is proceeding in such an orderly manner and the new structures are so nearly in keeping with the neighborhood that there has been a minimum disturbance of single-family residential values. These multiple housing structures are said to be the most uniform and well-built in the city. The area is surrounded by major arterials upon which outlying business establishments are located. Third Ave., which traverses the area, while not a business street, is an arterial thoroughfare and a traffic hazard. While 8 to 10 room mansions are scattered throughout the area, practically all improvements in the district north of Third and west of Normandie Sts. are of this type. In the district north of Third and west of Normandie Sts. are of this type. In the district north of First St. between Kenmore and Normandic Aves., there is a concentration of well-constructed 5 room bungalows, having an average of 20 years. Construction, maintenance and architectural designs of all types of improvements are of excellent quality. While the area is definitely declining from the standpoint of single family dwellings, it is felt that owing to the established character of the neighborhood, its favorable location and the economic stability of its home owners, it will remain a desirable residential district for many years to come. The area is therefore accorded a “high yellow” grade.',\n",

Upon expiration of deed restrictions, construction of residential income structures was very rapid.

As these stopped producing, zoning ordinances were enacted prohibiting this type of development. Since that time development has been steadily toward multi-family improvements. These cover many sizes and types and range from high-class apartment buildings to mediocre flats and bungalow courts.

The hatched section of the area is known as Mt. Washington and has an exceedingly rugged and broken terrain. Not to exceed 10% of this section is improved, although it contains many excellent view locations. The balance of the area has developed much more rapidly. Population of area contains many railroad employees and is inclined to be homogeneous. Architectural designs vary greatly and construction is generally of a low standard quality. Maintenance is spotted but usually of fair character. The area, while not definitely declining, apparently has but little future, although location is favorable. There is a wide variation in grades, running from “low” to “high” yellow in different blocks. It is therefore assigned a “medial yellow” grade.',\n",

Owing to wide age differential improvements have an inharmonious aspect. Population is inclined ot be heterogeneous. Improvements along Monte Vista St. and south are older than balance of area. There is a section between Mesa Ave. and Piedmont, east of Ave. 61, which is of better quality and of higher grade. This also might be said of several sections in the north and western part of area. In fact, grades run from “low” to “high” yellow in different parts. The main line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad bisects the lower part of area and unfavorably affects that section. Location of area is a favorable factor. Figueroa St. is an arterial highway and traffic hazard. The area is accorded a “medial yellow” grade.',\n",

Regardless of zoning the area is overwhelmingly single-family dwellings. Conveniences are all readily available, including inter-urban service to Los Angeles. This is the original residential section of the city of Alhambra and in most section sis quite heavily built up. Construction runs from substandard to standard and maintenance, while spotted, is generally of good quality. Population, improvements and architectural designs are strongly inclined to be heterogeneous. The eastern part of area is more sparsely settled and the greater part of the new construction has been in this section. While there is still a heavy percent of home ownership there is a strong tendency toward rental properties. There are four blocks east of Garfield north of Mission Road which contains 12 Negro families, who have lived in this location for many years. This is the only Negro concentration in the city and informed opinion is that this small settlement detrimentally affects only abutting blocks to the north and east. The area is so small that is was thought best to treat it in this way rather than by setting up a separate area. The area as a whole is well regarded and is assigned a “medial yellow” grade.',\n",

Conveniences are all readily available, including cheap rapid transit to Los Angeles. Parts of this area was subdivided over 25 years ago. It had its greatest growth, however, in the boom period of the middle 20’s. It was moribund during the depression but with the advent of FHA financing, activity began again. Construction ran from poor substandard to good standard quality. Population, improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are all heterogeneous. Structures range in age from new to 25 years or more. The section east of Garfield Ave. is largely small bungalows form Garfield to 6th St. There are a number of large outmoded residences which, while old, are well maintained and show high pride of ownership. From 6th St. west improvements are newer and more modern and include a number of small apartment houses and other multi-family structures. On 6th and 7th Sts. are a number of speculatively built substandard bungalows, some of them financed through FHA Title I loans. Lot values are quite reasonable, running from $10 to $15 per sq. ft. Individual blocks and small sections even will rate all the way from “low C” to “medial B” and it is possible that in time the area should be regarded.

This is the original San Gabriel settlement which was established at the time the Mission of that name was built in 1776. As it was in the beginning the neighborhood is distinctly Mexican and some of the descendants of the original inhabitants still reside in the area. With the exception of a few residences occupied by these old families, there is no apparent pride of occupancy or ownership. The vast majority of the population, while American-born, are still “peon Mexicans”, and constitute a distinctly subversive racial influence. Many of the Mexican-born inhabitants were repatriated during the depression years and their places in many cases are said to have been taken by hybrid Mexicans of American birth who are a distinctly less desirable type. Construction and maintenance are uniformly of poor quality and area has an extremely shabby and ill-kept appearance. This area is considered a menace to this whole section and pressure is being exerted to confine the population and keep it from infiltrating into other districts. The area is accorded a “medial red” grade.',\n",

Conveniences are all reasonably available, including proximity to downtown Hollywood. Street improvements are adequate in southern part of area, but in northern section many of the thoroughfares are dirt roads. This area was subdivided about 25 years ago and its greatest development was prior to 1925. Since that time Mulholland Dam at the northern boundary of the area has proved a definite hazzard to desirability, for while engineers pronounce the dam safe there is a wide spread popular feeling to the contrary. Construction is generally of high grade and maintenance shows pride of occupancy. Population is fairly homoegenous, and many original owners still occupy their homes. Improvements are characterized by age and obsolescence. There is a wide divergence of opinion among authorities regarding the grade of this area. However, the psychological hazard of the Mullholland Dam is thought to be a prime factor and, in order to \"flag\" this influence, the area is accorded a \"high red\". If however, as some ontend, the reservoir is discarded with the establishment of the water supply from Boulder Dam, there will be a sharp upturn in the grade of the area.',\n",

Mexicans are located in the blocks adjoining the cemetery on both its east and west borders. The section north of Santa Monica Blvd. and west of Gower St., known as the Cole Estate Tract, is of much better character than the rest of the area, and prices and rentals are materially higher.

This area was subdivided some 30 years ago and was developed as a workingman\\'s neighborhood. Construction and maintenance are of ordinary quality and quite spotted, giving the area a heterogeneous aspect. Population is of the low-income laboring group. Formerly the area was subject to flood, but recent flood control work is said to have overcome this difficulty. While zoned to permit multiple dwellings, there are but few of such structures, and these are mostly cheap rental units. The economic unstability indicated by the low-family income and the large amount of foreclosures which have taken place over the past few years, coupled with the presence of a limited amount of subversive racial elements and a possible flood hazard, does not warrant higher than the \"high red\" grade assigned.',\n",

Conveniences are all readily available. This area was subdivided between 35 to 40 years ago as a moderate income district. Since deed restrictions began to expire an infiltration of subversive elements started and has since gained in volume and has definitely lowered living standards. This is evidenced by the generally poor quality of maintenance in a large part of the area. Improvements, while old, are of standard construction. Population is extremely heterogeneous, there being a construction of Japanese south Temple St. and of Negroes west of Alvarado between Bellevue and Beverly Blvd. In addition to these concentrations there is a sprinkling of Russians and Mexicans. These adverse racial influences which are noticeably increasing inevitably pressage lower values, rentals and a rapid decrease of residential desirability.

The result is they are inextricably mixed. The district is the poorest residential section of Alhambra and is characterized by a heterogeneous population and improvements. Practically all of Alhambra\\'s subversion population is located here. While there are a few fairly presentable 5 room cottages on the outskirts, shacks and hovels predominate, giving the area a slum appearance. The rapid encroachment of industry during the past 10 years indicates that in time this will be considered in no sense a residential section. The area is assigned a \"low red\" grade. ',\n",

Maintenance, while spotted, is generally of poor character. Population and improvements are extremely heterogeneous.

It is said that the area was blighted by an ad valorem tax district bond issues which has been refunded during past year. In the process of this the county and city of Los Angeles acquired much property. Much undeveloped land plus relief from ad valorem bond taxes may stimulate the area; however, other subversive influences such as adjacence to oil wells and industry, proximity to city dump and presence of inharmonious racial elements, renders an improved grade highly questionable.

Improvements, while substandard in construction, are fairly maintained and evidence a certain pride of ownership. Population is of the lower income levels but on the whole are said to be more or less homogeneous. Regardless of these favorable qualities the area is blighted by its location and is therefore accorded a “high red” grade.',\n",

This is a typical beach resort area, and is extremely heterogeneous both as to population and improvements. Construction varies from \"shack\" to standard quality, with little or no attention to architectural design. Maintenance is generally of a low order. The section in the southeast part of Redondo Beach north of Juanita Ave. and the section in Hermosa Beach east of Camino Real, north of Pier Ave. are of better quality than balance of area, but proximity to oil wells precludes a higher grade. The Mexican population will be largely found in the many arroyos which traverse the area. The area as a whole is blighted and is accorded a \"medial red\" grade. ',\n",

There was no great decline here, so the new houses for sale in 1933 competed favorably with older homes in other districts, where large decline from top values had taken place. It is thought the average cost of new homes, $7,200. including lot and financing, may constitute an over-improvement. The upper part of this area is known as Wilshire Heights. A speculative builder, Mr. F.T. Dooley, has built most of the new homes in this area. Most of the new construction has been financed with F.H.A. loans.',\n",

The area was first put on as a subdivision in 1927 and many building and loan associations placed construction loans here. A number of these loans were foreclosed during the depression period and in consequence, there was an extraordinary drop in values. Some of the more pretentious homes, selling for as little as one-third of their original cost. For these reasons, recovery of values have been slow and halting in comparison with some of the older areas. There is a new highway under construction through the area at the present time and since January 1, 1937, there has been a renewed sales activity here. David D. Bohanon, a speculative builder, has purchased a large number of lots in this area and recently started a program of construction, which comtemplates the building of between three hundred and four hundred, five and six-room homes, the sale price of which will be about $4.50 per square foot, plus the price of the lot, which will average in the neighborhood of $1,000.00. The architecture and type of homes which already have been completed is such that if, as and when, the program is finished, it is possible that that particular portion of the area should be raised to an \"A\" Green grade. It is understood that this building activity will be largely financed with F.H.A. funds.',\n",

If and when this occurs, the single-family homes will be gradually demolished and multi-family dwellings will take their place. Land values govern prices to such an extent, that comparative values of single-family residences are extremely difficult.\",\n",

However, low percent of land improvements and many favorable factors indicate future prospects of better development. Large contiguous tracts of undeveloped land that can be purchased at acreage prices would seem to offer opportunity for speculation and/or resubdividing. That part of this area lying west of Edwards Avenue was seriously handicapped at the time it was subdivided and placed on the market some twelve years ago. The promoters offered a bonus of $50 worth of lumber with each lot, for the purpose of building temporary shelter. In many cases, the resulting shacks have been added to and improved until now there are many very small, poorly designed dwellings, showing little evidence of pride of ownership. Marketability is limited, values are problematical and the majority of residents have little financial responsibility. The area has been further handicapped by the installation of costly street improvements in 1930, which resulted in heavy property assessments and the subsequent loss of many lots and homes. These street improvements resulted in a scandal, involving several city officials. The bonds which were issued in payment, were sold for as little as twenty cents on the dollar and land values sank to the vanishing point. During the depression there were many foreclosures in this area and a large percentage of vacant houses. Recovery has been slow in a large part of the district. The city owns a reservoir site west of Tiller Avenue and south of Mountain Boulevard. The section east of this reservoir is sparsely settled and gives promise of developing into a higher grade area.',\n",

Is zoned 1 and 2-family residential, but over 95% improvements are single-family. Construction generally of good quality, homogeneity of social and income levels is fair to good. Including hatched portion of area, it is only about 25% developed. Is the fastest growing section of city, and when the hatched portion of area is developed, should be broken down and regarded. There is a high-grade, multi-family dwelling project in contemplation for this section. Under the circumstances, it is felt a provisional rating of low to medial green should be accorded. Is a keen competition for mortgages in area by all lending agencies, and bidding for loans is not uncommon. More than 25% of city's residential construction in 1937 was in this area.\",\n",

The homes are predominantly one and two story frame and frame stucco built, with a sprinkling of some apartment houses and apartment hotels and a few other multiple unit rentals. The cost of construction ranges from $5000.00 to $20,000.00. Residents are 100% white, being retired people, business and professional men, with an income range of $3000.00 to $15,000.00 per annum. Building restrictions by ordinance and deed. The apartment houses and other multiple income properties in this area do not detract from the residential desirability. Homes, for the most part, show high pride of ownership. There is no infiltration of inharmonious influences whatever. This is considered one of the most desirable areas of La Jolla. The beaches which are contiguous to this property are well maintained and under excellent supervision. Majority of the lots have a good view of the ocean and small park lying along the west edge. Streets are paved; all city conveniences are installed; adequate lighting facilities.

Probably average cost of construction in this Western area $2500. No building restrictions. It is a desirable area for the small home owner, and there is activity at this time in construction, and can be designated as a low blue, as against a high blue of the Eastern portion. At the Southeastern point of the Eastern portion of B-22 is a small tract known as Montemar-Vista. It is a small area of two blocks. Land sloping from North to South. The average cost of construction is approximately $3500. Most of the homes having been recently constructed. It would probably take the same rating as A-14, were it not for the fact that it is South of El Cajon Boulevard, which as a rule has a lower type of development than the property North of El Cajon; and also because of heavy paving bonds which have retarded sales.

Sparsely built up with more or less attractive homes of approximately four to seven rooms, certain portions of the area, especially along El Cajon Blvd. Are quite desirable. The eastern portion is in a Mattoon district, which fact has more or less retarded development. In the eastern portion the topography of the land is level and slightly rolling with a few canyons. Building for the most part is concentrated along El Cajon Avenue with a few small settlements north of El Cajon. Even in face of the Mattoon situation, the area is favorably regarded and has had some recent development. The residents are for the most part all white people, belonging to clerical group, mechanics, semi-professional and small-business men, with an income range from $1500 to $2000. The probably cost range of improvements will run from $1500 to $3500. Bus line runs along El Cajon Blvd. Very small portion of area is restricted as to building and for that reason there is no real uniformity as to architectural design. Certain portions of area are restricted by deed to a single family dwelling, with building restrictions of $3000 minimum. This is a difficult area to classify as it is hard to say just what development will take place and what type of development in the immediate future. Were the Mattoon situation adjusted, the area would in all probability develop quite rapidly. However, El Cajon Blvd. has definitely declined from a residential standpoint as this street is being improved with small businesses. There is no flood or other hazards. Fog condition light for this whole area. '}}},\n",

It is a strip of sand lots, 2 1/2 miles of peninsula, running north and south between Pacific Ocean, with beach the entire length and Mission Bay State park on the east. This area has average approximate width of four blocks. It is a typical Southern California beach community with no uniformity of buildings or restrictions. Construction costs range from $1000 to an extreme in a few instances of $15,000. Lots are small and houses are crowded. Rents during the summer are high and fairly low during winter months. Percentage of owner-occupied is probably 40%. It is probably 80% developed. The San Diego Electric Railway runs through the center of this area, along Mission Boulevard. Along this boulevard there are houses and business buildings of all descriptions. At the south end of the area the homes and business buildings of all descriptions. At the south end of the area the homes are more uniform and of better quality than the balance of the area. Just north of this part is the amusement center, which was constructed at a cost of approximately $3,500,000. The area is restricted to the Caucasian race. The present price of lots ranges from $350 to $2000. The winter population during the past year averaged 2500; summer 5000 and more. Various clubs, community club house for women, Parent Teach Ass'ns, Etc. are located in the area. As a recreational center and bathing beach it is considered excellent by local residents. However, it is not so highly desirable from a home standpoint. All paving and sewer assessments are paid for and there remains a two-year balance on sea-well assessments, which averages approximately $12.50 per lot per year. Residents consist of all classes of lower salaried white-collar workers, some business and professional men. Probable range of income of residents from $1000 to $1800 per year, with a few in higher brackets.\"}}},\n",

This area is located in Acquisition and Improvement District No. 1, City of San Diego, Causeway (Matoon Bond District). The homes are predominantly one-story frame cottages, ranging in age from 8 to 30 years and the probable cost of construction is from $750 to $2000. Homes show little pride of ownership. The particular area is set aside by common contest for the colored population. The majority of the streets are paved, with sidewalks and curbs. Street lighting adequate. There is located in this area, in addition to the residential homes, two lumber yards and one iceplant. The area is 95% developed; 55% rented, 40% home-owned.\"}}},\n",

Residents lower salaried classes, mostly whites and Mexicans with small earning capacity. The land was originally subdivided and sold off in very cheap lots and much of the area was used for small chicken and rabbit ranches, etc. The approach to the area is also detrimental to its future development as a good district. If the Mattoon situation did not exist in this area, it would be possible to pick out certain small districts that would probably take a higher rating than is herewith shown. However, the general attitude of local lending agencies is that the whole area is hazardous regardless of Mattoon assessments. No flood or other hazards. Fog condition very light, Portions of the area more or less remote from transportation and other conveniences, while other portions are fairly close to transportation, market, etc. The small town of Encanto having a small one-street business area of two or three blocks is also located herein.

       "    'area_description_data': {'1': 'This area consists of 35 irregularly-shaped blocks, the greater portion of which is known as Sea Cliff, located at the westerly end of the area. The narrow strip from 27th Avenue east to 16th Avenue is an older district, but it is highly regarded as a residential area even though some of the residences range up to 30 years in age. In Sea Cliff proper the oldest structure is approximately 18 years old, the bulk of the houses having been built ten years ago. Sea Cliff is highly restricted to single-family residences, both by ordinance and deed. The other section is zoned by ordinance only, and a few four-family flats and one or two apartments were built in this district before the zoning ordinance came into effect. This does not have a detrimental influence, however. The appraised values of the residences in Sea Cliff range from $9500 to $50,000, and in the area lying to the east, range from $5,000 to $25,000. The area is inhabited largely by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes ranging from $4,000 to $40,000. The income level of around $5,000 predominates. Infiltration of inharmonious racial elements is very remote, and maintenance is of a high order. There are comparatively to vacancies in this area, which is approximately 90% owner-occupied. Schools of all grades are within easy walking distance, transportation facilities are adequate, and parks and recreational areas are nearby. A few of the homes fronting on the ocean to the north have a privately-owned beach. Bordering on the north and east is the U.S. Military Reservation known as the Presidio, and a U.S. Marine Hospital and a large reservoir lie just outside the area. These are not considered a detrimental influence, but rather a benefit, as they are well-kept and insure seclusion. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $9,000. The same home would have rented for $90 a month in 1929, $60 a month in 1933, and $80 a month now.'}}},\n",

It is known as St. Francis Wood and ranks as one of the best laid out and restricted residential sub-divisions in San Francisco. The restrictions are first-residential, permitting single-family residences only, and their architecture is controlled by a board, resulting in uniformity and harmony in improvements. The tract is well-landscaped and is considered the most popular sub-division in its class. It has an undulating topography with rolling elevations from the east to the west, and the streets are contoured for easy grades and maximum construction for view. The improvements in this area have a cost range from $6,000 to $30,000, with the $10,000 house predominating. The range in age is from new to 20 years, the $10,000 house predominating. The range in age is from new to 20 years, the majority of the homes having been erected within the past 12 years. Good grade schools, transportation, parks, shopping, and recreational areas are conveniently located. There are no deterring influences, and there exists a very high percentage of home ownership, with practically no vacancies. There is an upkeep tax approximately $2,50 per lot monthly, which is judiciously expended in keeping up parks, tennis courts, etc. which belong to the tract. This expenditure has resulted in a neighborhood of great charm and attractiveness, which adds materially to property values in the area. The lots in this sub-division maintained their values even during the depression period. Lots are selling for as high as $5,000, which is approximately the peak. The residents of this tract are made up of professional people, business executives, and a few retired capitalists, having an income range from $5,000 to $40,000. The marketability for property in this area is the highest in the entire district. This is partly due to the high standard of maintenance and proper restrictions that exist. There are a number of homes being built in this area, and construction loans area eagerly sought by all mortgagee institutions. A standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $15,000 in 1929, $10,500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $13,500. The same homes would have rented for $125 a month in 1929, $90 a month in 1933, and $105 a month now.'}}},\n",

       "    'area_description_data': {'1': 'This area, with the exception of the two blocks in the northeast, is known as Sherwood Forest, a sub-division placed on the market in 1929 as a high-class residential park with a minimum building restriction of $10,000. The average size of the building sites is from 75 to 100 feet frontage. Up to 1935 only two residences were constructed in this tract, and during the past year four additional homes were erected at a cost of from $15,000 to $25,000. This area is creating considerable interest at the present time, and as the restrictions are rigidly maintained, it is believed that development will continue at a moderate rate. The property is located on the western and northern slope of Mt. Davidson, which is the highest point in San Francisco, having an elevation of 985 feet. The character of the sub-division is hilly with one or two ravines. A portion of the tract is unplanted and adjoins a 20 acre city park which includes the peak of Mt. Davidson. Residents of this tract are professional men and business executives having incomes in excess of $10,000 per year. The sub-division is somewhat remote from transportation, schools, and stores; however, with its type of inhabitants, this is not considered a serious handicap due to the fact that there are two or more automobiles in each family, with domestic help. This property, adjoining a city park, nestles on the wooded slopes of Mt. Davidson, and having an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean for a distance of 50 miles, forms a picturesque setting for high-class development. A deterring incidence affecting this area is the season of intermittent fogs and winds which is recurrent for three or four months of the year in this section. When this sub-division was placed on the market, the sites were priced from $4,000 to $15,000, according to their size and location. However, no sales were made at these values, and the maximum price obtained to date is $45 per front foot. It is believed that, with the return of normal conditions and a better planned and more aggressive-selling campaign, it will be possible to obtain as much as $7500 for some of the choice sites. Taxes are assessed on a basis of $60 per front foot on the platted portion of the area and at $300 per acre on the unplanted part. The area is 100% owner-occupied, and there are no detrimental influences other than those indicated. The two blocks lying to the northeast are in the sub-division known as Miraloma Park, which is 85% built-up of homes ranging from $4,000 to $6,000. As these two blocs adjoin Sherwood Forest, they maintain a fairly high standard of occupancy of professional men and junior executives.'}}},\n",

       "    'area_description_data': {'1': 'This area, consisting of some 20 blocks of various sizes and shapes, is 95% developed, the greater portion is situated in what is known as Balboa Terrace, Tract 1 and 2, with a small portion of the best part of MT. Davidson Manor being included in the eastern part of the area. The first construction in Balboa Terrace began in 1921, and a consistent construction program continued until 1929. This tract is located on a general slope to the west and south and is admirably suited to residential construction. It is particularly appealing to people with families, as it adjoins one of the best elementary and junior high schools in San Francisco, is adjacent to two direct car lines, and has adequate shopping and recreational facilities close at hand. This is one of the few subdivisions in the city that has rear alleys for automobile driveways, eliminating the garage entrance from the street which is very common in San Francisco. The type of homes is mostly one-story, stucco, detached with five to eight rooms, having a cost range of from $5,000 to $12,500. The property is protected by deed restrictions, and zoning is first-residential. There is an upkeep tax of approximately $1.00 per month, and the parking is well-maintained. The district is 95% owner-occupied by people of the high salaried \"white-collar\" class, business executives, and professional men. Property in this area is in popular demand, and its marketability has been above average throughout the depression. That portion of Mt. Davidson Manor which is included in this area is slightly below the standard of the homes in Balboa Terrace; however, the general character is the same. A standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $12,000 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $10,500. The same home would have rented for $100 a month in 1929, $65 a month in 1933 and $90 a month now. This area occupies an attractive setting, is harmonious in both development and population. A possible deterring influence which was considered when according the area an \"A\" rating was its high percentage of development. An off-setting factor was that property in the area is in good demand, selling readily at fair prices, and that mortgage institutions generally are willing to accord their best terms on residential loans in the area.'}}},\n",

This area is located on a rolling knoll and slopes in all four directions, affording an excellent view from many of the sites. The subdivision was placed on the market in 1925 and is about 65% developed. it is an extremely popular section at the present time, and some 50 new homes were erected within its confines during the past year. There are a few steep slopes, but usually the building sites are fairly level, and practically all afford a view. The platting of the area was an admirable piece of engineering. The homes have a cost range of from $6,000 to $25,000 in Monterey Heights and from $5,000 to $12,500 in Westwood Highlands. There area a few more costly houses on some imposing knolls; however, the $8,000 house predominates. The majority of the houses have canvas walls, tile baths, with the latest modern features, most of them of the two-story variety with from six to nine rooms. The area is properly restricted by deed and zoning, and it is 90% owner-occupied, largely by professional people and business executives having incomes of from $4,000 to $10,000. This area is served by bus transportation, and is only fairly convenient to good schools and shopping districts. Marketability was slow just prior to and during the depression. However, it is increasing rapidly and becoming a popular district. With the normal growth that is now existing, it is estimated that this area will be 90% developed within the next two years. The only detrimental influence, other than those indicated, is the seasonal fogs and wind from the ocean, which applies to the entire area comprising the western part of San Francisco. Many F. H. A Title II loans are being made in this area, and competition among mortgagee institutions for them is very keen. This factor is believed to be a potent one in stimulating development in the area. In addition to this, the area has an attractive setting, is being harmoniously developed, and is in the path of normal growth. A standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $12,500 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $11,000. The same home would have rented for $100 a month in 1929, $65 a month in 1933, and $85 a month now. '}}},\n",

There are really two parts to the area, and it is deemed best to describe them separately. The North part is the frontage on Marina Boulevard from Buchanan Street to the Presidio wall at Lyon Street. These lots are generally 30 feet wide and overlook the Bay, with the Marina hills in the background. They face directly on either a park or yacht harbor. Although they occupy \"made land\" which was formerly part of the 1915 Exposition Site, these lots have maintained a value of from $200 to $250 a front foot even through the depression, and the average cost of the homes range from $12,500 to $20,000, with one or two a little more costly. The neighborhood is very popular, and owing to the limited area, it is anticipated that there will always be good demand for this frontage. The western part of the area is situated upon natural ground, and 25 foot lots predominate. The improvements consist of one and two-story, six to nine-room dwellings, with a cost range of from $7,000 to $15,000, and is also considered very desirable residential property. This part of the area borders \"C-7\" which contains a large number of three-story apartments and flats. The break from \"green\" to \"yellow\" is justified by the high character of these multi-unit improvements. This entire area is practically 95% built-up and nearly all owner-occupied by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes ranging from $5,000 to $20,000. Climatic conditions are favorable. Threat of discordant racial infiltration is very remote. Pride of ownership is high, and the demand for property in this section held better than in any other section in San Francisco during the depression. A standard eight-room house in the north part would have sold for $17,500 in 1929, $13,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $17,500.

This area is zoned 'first-residential'; however, there are no deed restrictions.

Buildings in this area range from new to an age of 40 years and have a cost range of from $20,000 to $150,000 or more. Owing to the architectural and structural soundness of its improvements and desirability of location, it is difficult to determine the remaining economic life of this district. None of the older improvements have been allowed to become obsolete, and they have been in many cases entirely remodeled and completely modernized. It is quite possible, owing to its natural advantages and the other factors mentioned, that this district will remain the outstanding residential district of San Francisco for a great many years to come. It is not feasible to estimate the fluctuation in values of a typical house in this district during the past eight years, for two reasons: first, that there is no typical house in this area of the smaller variety and, secondly, in the bottom of the depression there was absolutely no market for property of the predominating type in this area. Considerable activity is shown in this class of property at the present time, and it is safe to say that prices will soon be back to the 1929 level.\"}}},\n",

This area is located in what is known as the \"West of Twin Peaks\" section, the most popular medium-priced, better-class section in San Francisco. This section or district of San Francisco is, generally speaking, the only portion that carries deed restrictions and has the added advantage of being sub-divided into wider lots occupied by detached homes. The improvements in this area consist mainly of one-story, frame, single-family residences of five to eight rooms, all stucco exteriors, detached, and many of them having tiled roofs. The cost range of dwellings is from $7,000 to $12,000. No building in this area is older than five years, and over 50%f were constructed within the past two years. F. H. A. Title II loans have been a large factor in the development of this area, which is inhabited largely by the medium-income \"white collar\" class, professional men, small business owner, and executives, having incomes ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 or more. Property is protected by single-family deed restrictions and \"first-residential\" zoning. There are no racial threats, and maintenance is of a high order. The area is 95% owner-occupied, with no vacancies and is approximately 60% built-up. Building activity in this area is very brisk, and as the owners of the three sub-divisions are builders and developers, it is logical to assume that the entire area will be 95% developed within the next two years. Property has some view, convenience to schools, transportation, and recreational areas. A parked reservoir adds to the charm of the neighborhood. This is considered the \"hot spot\" of new residential construction in the $8,000 to $12,500 class. Presuming its existence, a standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $13,500 in 1929, $8,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $12,500. The same home would have rented for $110 a month in 1929, $75 a month in 1933 and $95 a month now. The prevalence of high percentage to cost mortgage loans in this area constitutes a detrimental influence sufficient to warrant a designation of \"low green\".'}}},\n",

This tunnel, 2 1/4 miles long, was completed in 1916 and supplies direct rail transportation from the area known as \"West of the Twin Peaks\" to the City Center and other points. The construction of this tunnel opened up some three or four thousand acres of dormant land into a better-type of restricted sub-division. The average size of lots in this area is 33 1/3 by 100 feet. The street improvements, though costly due to the topography, were not accepted by the city and are being kept in repair by the Forest Hill Association, a non-profit corporation made up of property owners within the tract, for the purpose of maintaining streets, landscaping, and generally enforcing the restrictions. This association is functioning well, and the tract and streets are well-maintained. There is a special tax levy of 3/10 of a mill per square foot monthly for maintenance. Most of the residences in this tract are of the two-story, six to eight-room type, their prices ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, protected by deed restriction and zoning to single-family residences only. The tract is approximately 60% built-up and largely owner-occupied with less than 3% vacancy. Portion of this sub-division are convenient to shops, schools, and transportation, while other portions are somewhat removed from transportation facilities. The residents in this area are largely made up of the \"white collar\" class in the middle-salaried brackets and professional and business men, having an income range from $2500 to $7500. Infiltration of inharmonious social elements is not anticipated. This tract was slow to develop; therefore, there are homes ranging in age from new to 25 years, with the majority of the buildings erected within the past 10 years. This area adjoins the Laguna Hona Home for the Aged. This does not constitute a detrimental influence, however, as the grounds are highly landscaped and well-maintained. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $6500 in 1933, and $9,000 at the present time. It would have rented for $90 a month in 1929, $60 a month in 1933 and $80 per month now.'}}},\n",

These three tracts were subdivided in 1915; however, there was but little building activity prior to 1920. These three tracts surround the western portal of the Twin Peaks Tunnel. The first three blocks on West Portal Avenue from the entrance of the tunnel are zoned for commercial purposes, two blocks of which have been built up with stores comprising a very high-class community business center, with theatres, excellent food shops, etc. This well-developed little business center has a good influence on residential property values, even on those immediately adjoining the stores. This area is made up largely of one-story, five and six-room, detached homes, having a cost range of from $4,000 to $7,500, with 80 to 90% owner-occupancy and few vacancies. The majority of the buildings in this area were erected between eight and twelve years ago. The residents in this area are made up of small business and professional men, office workers, and junior executives, having an income range from $2200 to $5,000. This area is restricted to single-family dwellings, both by deed and zoning. This section is very popular, partly due to being conveniently located to excellent schools, shops and transportation facilities. Maintenance of property in the area is notably good, and there are no known detrimental influences or threats. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $9500 in 1929, $5500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $8500. The same home would have rented for $95 per month in 1929, $50 per month in 1933, and $75 per month now.'}}},\n",

It constitutes the western portion of the \"Richmond District\", and is zoned second-residential, with the exception of one block and five half-blocks, zoned first residential, and 37 quarter-blocks on Balboa and Cabrillo Streets zoned for business. A well developed shopping center occupies this zoning. There are no deed restrictions. The area is popular with the medium income group of professional and business me, \"white collar\" workers, and higher-class skilled mechanics and artisans. Annual incomes range from $1800 to $5,000. There is no threat of undesirable racial influences. The eastern part of the area is 90% built-up, tapering off to 50% in the extreme western portion, being 75% to 80% developed as a whole. Improvements consist of stucco, frame and stucco, row and detached houses and bungalows, costing from $4,000 to $7,000, with a number of two-family flats and small corner apartment houses in the $7,000 to $12,000 cost range. While somewhat heterogeneously developed in spots, maintenance is generally good, indicating a pride of ownership. A few buildings were erected some 30 years ago, but a majority of the property has been improved since 1920. On the northwest boundary of the area, below a bluff, lies the far-framed \"cliff House\" and \"Seal Rocks\"; on the south it joins Golden Gate Park, while to the north is the Lincoln Park Municipal Gold Links. These all add to the attractiveness of the district. Good schools, and churches are conveniently located, and the area, which is densely populated, is served by four car lines to the City Center, which is four or 4 1/2 miles distant. This distance from the down-town district and the time consumed in getting there, is a deterring influence, as is the fog and wind condition which prevails at certain seasons of the year. Although rising land values tend to increase the burden of ownership, the tax situation as a whole is equitable. The classification of this area as \"blue\" does not complete the picture. There are spotted blocks here and there which could be designated \"high yellow\", and on the other hand, there area scattered blocks fronting Golden Gate Park which could be classed as \"low green\". There are also 12 blocks in the northwest section of the area adjoining Sutro Heights and the military reservation, which are hilly and afford a pleasing view of the Pacific Oceas and Golden Gate Park, that are less than 50% improved and give evidence of developing into a higher grade, possibly a \"high blue\" or \"low green\". At present the same general characteristics justify the inclusion of this district in one area, but within ten years it will have to be broken up into a number of separate units. Already parts have reached a peak and are in that static stage which precedes a decline. Marteksbility in the area is generally good, with values tending upward. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8,000 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6750. The same house would have rented for $75 in 1929, $47.50 in 1933, and $65 now.'}}},\n",

The area is zoned second-residential, but there are no apartment houses, and owing to a high degree of development, but little likelihood of there being any. Primary grade schools are convenient, but high school facilities are at some distance. Transportation facilities are good, and its nearness to Gold Gate Park and the beaches is a beneficial influence. The blocks bordering Sunset Boulevard are particularly attractive, and the area as a whole should be graded a \"high blue\". A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6750. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $40 in 1933 and $60 now.

The topography is undulating and admirably suited to residential development. It is inhabited by professional people, business men, and skilled artisans, having incomes of $2400 to $5,000. There are no racial concentrations or threats, and maintenance shows a high degree of pride of ownership. Improvements consist largely of single-family, detached, stucco and frame bungalows and houses, having a cost range of $4500 to $10,000 and an average age of 7 or 8 years. The district was platted and put on the market 10 years ago, but its development was arrested by the depression, and it is more or less dormant at the present time. The area is zoned first-residential and is also protected by deed restrictions. There is little or no vacancy in the area, and the percentage of owner-occupancy is high. Schools and transportation are not conveniently available, but parks and recreational areas are nearby. The setting of the area is very charming, and it is believed that when lack of school and transportation facilities are overcome, this area may progress into a \"green\" classification. Currently, the property in the area is dormant and offers a high degree of sales resistance. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $6,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7500.

The western side of these hills is very precipitous, and a splendid view of the surrounding country is to be had from all parts of the area. This is a new development recently undertaken by Mr.. Henry Dolger and the Standard Building Company. Up to the present time the development probably does not amount to more than 5 or 6% of the area but has progressed sufficiently to indicate that the area will probably be occupied by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes of $5,000 or more. Judging from the buildings which have already been erected, the development will consist of single-family residences running to the mansion type constructed of brick, stucco, and stone. The area is zoned first-residential and is also protected by deed restrictions. To date, it is 100% owner-occupied. Schools and transportation, except by private automobile, are not conveniently available, and high winds and fogs also constitute a detrimental influence. It is said that the promotion is not going very well and that the property offers considerable sales resistance.

Its topography is of an undulating character suitable for residential purposes. It occupies a sheltered section between Golden Gate Heights and Mt. Sutro. The northwestern portion of Forest Hill and Windsor Terrace are included in this area. Population consists largely of professional and business men of the junior executive type, skilled artisans, and \"white collar\" workers, having incomes ranging from $2,000 to $6,000. There is little likelihood of the area having racial difficulties. Maintenance indicates great pride of ownership. Improvements consist largely of single-family frame and stucco, row and detached bungalows and two-story residences, having a value ranging from $4,000 to $10,000 and an average age of eight to ten years. Property in this area was put on the market some 25 years ago, and it has been slowly developing since that time. Some large blocks in the southern portion and two in the northern portion are zoned first-residential, the balance of the area being zoned second-residential. There are, however, no apartment houses or flats in the area, and it does not seem probable that there will be an invasion of this class of construction. There is little or no vacancy in the area, and 80 to 90% of the property is owner-occupied. The southeastern part of the area, which is a part of \"Forest hill\", would have been included in \"A-7\" had it not been for its inaccessibility. The balance of the area is not so isolated, and schools of all grades are within walking distance; a car line and bus line traverse this part of the area, and other amenities are conveniently near. There is a fairly stable demand for property in this neighborhood. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $42.50 in 1933, and $60 now. '}}},\n",

Davidson on a bench or terrace, as there are but few steep slopes in the area. The developed section of Miraloma Terrace and a portion of Laguna Honda Park are included in this area. The population consists largely of \"white collar\" employees, small business men, skilled artisans, and a few professional people, having an income range of from $2,000 to $4500. There are no racial concentrations in the area and but little likelihood of there ever being. The area as a whole is well-maintained and a definite pride of ownership is discernible. Improvements of the area consist of single-family, detached, stucco, and frame houses and bungalows, costing from $4,000 to $6500, having an average age of not to exceed seven years. Part of this area was originally platted many years ago without regard to the terrain. About 12 years ago it was re-platted and placed on the market, and development continued somewhat throughout the depression. It is zoned first-residential, is 80% owner-occupied, with about 1% vacancies. There is a small neighborhood business district in the north-central portion of the area. Schools of all grades are available but are not conveniently so. There is a bus line running through the western portion, from which it is necessary to transfer to get to the down-town areas, and a splendid arterial highway runs through its northern section. A proposed city park, if created, would adjoin the area on the east. Aside from being somewhat isolated, there are no detrimental influences, and the area constitutes a harmonious development, which it is believed will prove a stable one. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $42.50 in 1933, and $62.50 now. '}}},\n",

Improvements consist of single-family, detached bungalows and houses of various types, materials, and architectural designs, having/an average age of from 12 to 15 years with values ranging from $4,000 to $8,000. This subdivision was placed on the market about 25 years ago and is zoned first-residential and is also protected by deed restrictions. It is 85% owner-occupied, and there are less than 1% vacancies. Schools of all grades are within easy walking distance, and the area has both street car and bus line service. It adjoins a section of Balboa Park, upon which it is proposed to build a large reservoir. However, it is not believed that this will prove a detrimental influence. Property in the area enjoys a fair degree of marketability. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $80 in 1929, $45 in 1933, and $60 now.'}}},\n",

The inhabitants consist largely of professional and business men of the executive type with incomes ranging from $4,000 to $10,000. There are no racial concentrations, and racial problems are considered very remote. Maintenance throughout the district evidences a very high degree of pride of ownership. The improvements have an average age of five years, the district which is eight years old has a number of very attractive homes, harmonious but individual in character--some of them bordering upon the mansion type, and having a cost range of $8,000 to $20,000. The area is zoned second-residential but is protected by its topography, and homes therein are 100% owner-occupied. A grade school is adjacent to the area, but high school facilities are not as convenient, and transportation accommodations, except by privately owned cars, are just fair, the neighborhood being served by bus lines running on Clayton Street. Parks and recreational areas are available, and the far-reaching views offer a very attractive scenic feature. The area is in a more or less sheltered location, which protects from fog and winds but also has the effect of keeping out much needed sunshine, at certain seasons this is quite noticeable and is undoubtedly a deterring influence. The district is not yet fully developed, but in the improved portion street improvements and street lighting are installed. There are some street improvement assessments in the area, and paving contractor was forced to take over some vacant property in the area for part of the cost of the street improvement; however, this property has largely been sold now. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $7,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7500.

The inhabitants are largely small business men, \"white collar\" employees, and skilled artisans, having an income range of $1800 to $3600. There are no racial concentrations, and the possibilities of racial problems in the future seem very remote. The improvements are well-maintained and consist of frame and stucco, row and detached, single-family dwellings, with a cost range of $3500 to $6,000 and an average of 12 years. With the exception of a small neighborhood business center, the area is zoned first-residential, and is partly protected with deed restrictions. The homes are 85% owner-occupied with approximately 2% vacancies. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks, etc. are conveniently available, the climatic condition is excellent, and the small business section in the northern part of the district is considered a beneficial influence. Many mortgagee institutions will make maximum term loans in this area and F. H. A Title II loans are freely granted. Some of the more conservative institutions, however, are inclined to curtail their terms. A six room home in this area, costing $7,000 in 1929, sold for $4500 in 1933 and is now valued at $5750. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $40 in 1933, and $52.50 now. A vacant lot sold for $1500 in 1929, for $600 in 1933 and is now valued at $1100.'}}},\n",

Maintenance, for the most part is of good character and shows pride of ownership. The district is 30 years old and was one of the \"hot spots\" at one time. It is improved with single-family, row and detached residences of frame, brick, and stucco, with a cost range of $4,000 to $15,000 and an average age of 15 to 20 years. The area is zoned second-residential but is protected by its topography and partially by deed restrictions. Homes are 90% owner-occupied with not to exceed 2% vacancies. There are some apartment houses in the lower part of the area where is not protected by deed restrictions. The development is not wholly harmonious. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas are conveniently available, and the fact that the district is somewhat subject to wind and fog conditions is offset by the outlook and convenience to down-town centers which account for the steady demand at fair prices for property in this area. Owing to the age of the district, many mortgagee institutions are inclined to limit the amortization period on loans made in the area; however, it is understood F. H. A.

In the last dozen years, however, artists, professional and business men, with incomes ranging from $3,000 to $10,000 have moved into the area and built homes costing from $8,000 to $20,000, and there has been an exodus of the lower class social elements.

A magnificent view, however, is obtained, and it has the added advantage of being very close to the down-town districts. The property in the district is in demand at increasing prices. The \"Renaissance of Telegraphy Hill\" emphasizes and illustrates what is taking place in a less pronounced degree in many San Francisco districts in what might be termed \"reviving areas\". This area is in no sense a declining one and has been a particularly hard one to grade owing to the mixed type of occupants and for the further reason that it is in a state of transition. It is given a \"high yellow\" designation with the thought that it may eventually develop into a higher grade.

The district is 50 years old and is located upon the westerly slope of what is known as \"Lone Hill\". With the exception of a few business locations, it is zoned second-residential, and its improvements consist of a heterogeneous mixture of frame and stucco, detached and row single-family residences of various ages, together with a very large number of flats and apartment houses. The single-family dwellings are approximately 70% owner-occupied, and owing to its proximity to schools, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas, it has a very small percentage of vacancy, probably not to exceed 3%. The northeast portion of the area joins one of the heaviest racial concentrations in the city, and while non-existent in this area at the present time, there is an undoubted threat of infiltration in the future. Negotiations are said to be under way by a responsible group of the purchase of Calvary Cemetery for the purpose of sub-dividing it. Should this become an accomplished fact, it will have a very beneficial effect upon this area. This possibility has some bearing upon the grading of this area which is accorded a rating of \"low yellow\". Loan applications in this area are closely scrutinized and are usually made upon a very conservative basis.

The topography, however, is generally favorable to residential construction, although there are a few steep slopes and bluffs in the southern part of the area. The northern part, with an elevation of 250 feet, is comparatively smooth. The residents consist largely of business and professional men, junior executives, and better-paid \"white collar\" workers, having an income range of from $1800 to $4,000 a year. There are no racial concentrations, and the danger of infiltration of foreign elements is remote. As a whole, maintenance shows a fair degree of pride of ownership. The district is from 15 to 35 years old and has gradually developed during that period until it is now 85% built-up, the improvements consisting largely of single-family detached and row houses and bungalows of various architectural designs and types of construction. A few blocks are zoned first-residential, but the zoning is mainly second-residential, although there are but few apartment houses in the area and not a great many flats. There is 85% to 90% owner-occupancy and vacancies do not exceed 2%. There is, of course, a threat of more flats and apartments being built in the area, but it is believed that it will continue to be preponderantly a single-family residential area. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, and recreational areas are all conveniently available, and there are no detrimental influences. This area might almost be graded a \"low blue\" were it not for the considerable amount of obsolescence discernible. Loan applications in the area are favorably received by all mortgagee institutions and loans in many cases are made upon maximum terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8000 in 1929, 44500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $75 in 1929, $45 in 1933, and $65 now.'}}},\n",

Schools or all grades, transportation facilities, parks, and playgrounds are all conveniently available. Owing to its remoteness, there is a degree of sales resistance to property in this area. New construction in the area which is limited in extent is of a higher order than existing improvements, and this is an indication that in time this area may reach a higher grade. There is a tendency upon the part of mortgagee institutions to stiffen the terms on loans made in the area. However, the F. H.

Many of the inhabitants area of Irish descent and are occupied as \"white collar\" workers, skilled and semi-skilled laborers, and city employees, with an income range of $1500 to $3000. There are no unfavorable racial conditions nor likelihood of such concentration in the future. Portions of the area show a fair degree of maintenance, but the development is inharmonious, construction consisting of single and multi-family houses and flats of many types and materials. The district is more than 50 years old, and the improvements average in age from 25 to 30 years and have a cost range of $3000 to $7,000. The area is zoned second-residential, and there is an 80% owner-occupancy, with approximately 2% vacancies. A primary school is convenient, but high-school facilities are at some distance, and transportation facilities are only fair. Parks and recreational areas are available, however, and there is a favorable climatic condition. Loans upon favorable terms are readily accorded by most of the institutions of the city. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6,000 in 1929, $4,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5,000. The same home would have rented for $57.50 in 1929, $40 in 1933, and $47.50 now.'}}},\n",

It is occupied by professional and business men and \"white collar\" workers, having an income range of from $2,000 to $15,000. There are many beautiful single-family residences, both of the two-story and bungalow type, constructed of frame and stucco. This is particularly true of the northwest part of the area bordering \"A-4\", and if it were not for the predominance of apartments and multi-family dwellings, this section would have been made a part of \"B-12\". The situation described accounts for the break from \"green\" to \"yellow\", which occurs where this area adjoins \"A-4\". A small part of this area is situated on \"made\" ground formerly occupied by the 1915 Exposition. Improvements consist of three-story apartments and flats and two-story and bungalow type, single-family, frame and stucco, row dwellings. Many of the single-family residences have distinction and beauty. The single-family dwellings have a cost range of from $6,000 to $12,000, with a large percentage of owner-occupancy and practically no vacancies. In the southern part of the area the dwellings are older, some of them being 30 years or more. Maintenance, however, is of a high order. There is a modern, high-grade neighborhood business center running for four blocks along Chestnut Street, which adds to the convenience and attractiveness of the area. Schools, recreational areas, and transportation facilities are all available, and property in the district is readily marketable. The average age of improvements in the area is less than 15 years, and it is by no means \"definitely declining\". In fact, it is still developing, being not to exceed 90% built up. One possible derogatory feature lies in the fact that one of the approaches to the Golden Gate Bridge, which will soon be completed, runs through this area. While a \"C\" designation has been given, it should be understood that it is a \"high yellow\". Grading of this area was very difficult, and determination was finally made largely upon the preponderance of income property which it contains. The single block bordering the Presidio is the entrance to that military reservation. While some mortgagee institutions refuse to lend in this territory, they are in the minority, loans being usually eagerly sought for upon maximum terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $7,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $8750. The same home would have rented for $95 in 1929, $70 in 1933, and $85 now.'}}},\n",

The area is zoned second-residential with a few blocks on the outskirts given over to neighborhood shops and markets. Single-family dwellings are 80% owner-occupied, 23% rented, and 2% vacant. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas are all conveniently available, and splendid climatic conditions prevail. Holly Park, including one of the city\\'s reservoirs, is within the confines of the area. This district would have been accorded a higher grading had it not been for the undesirable influences of the areas which surround it on the northwest and east, and from which there is an infiltration of lower income groups.

The names of the streets are a fair index of the cosmopolitan character of its inhabitants. The population is thought to be more or less stationary and in many ways exhibit characteristics indicative of pride of ownership. A heterogeneous development has existed in this area over the past 35 years. Dwellings consist of single and multi-family, row houses and bungalows of many types of architecture and construction, having a cost range of from $1500 to $5,000 when new. The area is zoned first residential, with fractional blocks along Mission, Brazil, and Russia Streets reserved for business. The homes are 75% owner-occupied, 20% rented and 5% vacant. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas are all conveniently available, and general climatic conditions are favorable. There is evidence that this district may develop into a higher grading. Some mortgagee institutions do not include the area in their lending territory, but a majority will receive applications and make loans upon variously modified terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $4250 in 1929, $3000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3750.

It was one of the exclusive districts in San Francisco's early history, some of the old mansions still being used for institutional purposes and lodging houses. It is now largely inhabited by factory workers and laborers, with incomes ranging from $800 to $2400. Many nationalities are represented, but there is no racial concentration, in broad sense of the term. Maintenance is what would naturally be expected in a low-income community. The area is from 50 to 60 years old, and improvements consist of an inharmonious conglomeration of old houses, bungalows, flats, and apartments, sprinkled with shops, markets, and small industrial establishments. Single-family dwellings, aside from old shacks, have a cost range of from $2500 to $5,000. They consist mainly of frame, row single and multi-family dwellings ranging in age from 8 to 60 years many of them being of the old mansion type. The area is principally zoned second-residential, but many blocks are given over to business and light industry. The single-family units are 50% owner-occupied, 45% rented, and 5% vacant. School and transportation facilities, together with parks, and recreational areas, are conveniently available. Two factors which constitute detrimental influences are the packing house district which is not far to the eastward and a Southern Pacific Railroad spur track which transverses the area. This area is in the sunshine zone, and climatic conditions are good. Owing to its decadent condition few mortgagee institutions will entertain applications for residential loans in this area. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5,000 in 1929, $3,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4,000.

It is inhabited largely by factory workers, and laborers with incomes ranging from $800 to $2400. Many nationalities are represented, but there is no inharmonious racial concentration. Maintenance is spotted and while a fair degree of pride of ownership is noticeable many of the home are unkempt. The area is some 50 years of age, and has been developing slowly and in a hetero generous manner. The improvements largely consist of small homes of various ages with a cost range of from $2,000 to $3500. It is zoned second-residential with some provision for business. There is a high percentage of owner-occupancy probably as much as 75% with approximately 5% vacancy. School and transportation facilities, parks and recreational areas are conveniently available. It adjoins an industrial area on the east which contains the Packing House District. The prevailing winds, however, are from the west which minimizes the odors. The climate in this area is one of the best in the City. Many of the mortgagee institutions exclude this area from their renting territory, but it is believed that sound loans may be made in the area on modified terms if care is exercised. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $4250 in 1929, $3,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3750.

The area is 80% owner-occupied, with few vacancies, and a fair degree of maintenance was observed in a considerable part of the area. The zoning is second-residential, and the topography also offers protection from unfavorable encroachments. Schools of all grades are conveniently available, two schools being located within the area; transportation facilities are also good, and recreational areas are provided by the three playfields which adjoin the area. Light and heavy industrial districts completely surround the area, and stockyards meat packing plants situated nearby are the source of unpleasant odors when the wind is from their direction, which, fortunately is seldom. A railroad tunnel runs under part of the area. The best climatic conditions in San Francisco are said to exist in this area.

Topographically, this should be set up as three areas, but other wise the area is comparatively uniform in character. The population is made up of factory workers, skilled and semi-skilled laborers and artisans, with incomes ranging from $800 to $2400. There are no racial problems, and possibility of any is considered remote. Maintenance, while spotted, shows a degree of pride of ownership. The district has slowly developed over the past 30 years, and though continuing to show activity, is still only 60 to 65% built-up. Improvements consist of varying styles and types of row and detached, frame and stucco, one and two-story single-family dwellings, the average age being 10 to 35 years. There is an 80% owner-occupancy and about 3% vacancy. The area is zoned first-residential with provision for neighborhood trading centers. Primary grade schools are located in the district, but high school facilities are some distance away. Park and recreational area are nearby, but part of the area lacks adequate transportation. With the development of McLaren Park, this adverse factor will probably cease to exist. While proximity to industrial district and low level of income and improvements, together with other handicaps, preclude a higher rating than has been given, there are indications that parts of the area may develop into higher grades. Climatic conditions in the area are excellent. There is a wide diversity of opinion among officials of mortgagee institutions regarding this area. A few do not include the area in their lending territory, while others viewing the area from its natural advantages and future possibilities are inclined to be generous in their terms where improvements are in keeping with the district. Generally speaking, loans are made in the area upon modified terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $4500 in 1929, $3250 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3750. The same income would have rented for $48.50 in 1929, $30 in 1933, and $37.50 now. '}}},\n",

It is zoned second-residential and business, and is very largely given over to small apartment houses and flats, many of them with stores occupying the first floor. There are, however, a goodly number of old single-family residences which were at one time occupied by higher income business people and professional men. These are now largely owned and tenanted by small business men, \"white collar\" workers, and skilled artisans having incomes of from $1200 to $3,000. On account of age there is a possible threat of an infiltration of inharmonious racial elements. However, no concentrations exist at the present time. The single-family residences had a cost when new of from $4,000 to $10,000, and consist largely of frame construction. The area is 95% built-up, and the single-family residences are 80% owner-occupied with not to exceed 3% vacancies. Owing to its convenience to schools, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational area, there is a fair demand for property in this area. The area is very spotted and one or two blocks might be classified as \"high yellow\". Land values have a tendency to increase the burden of ownership of single-family residences. This area has distinct possibilities as a medium to a high-grade apartment house district. Mortgagee institutions are inclined to be quite conservative about making loans on one to four-family residential units, and several officials stated that they would not consider loans on single-family residences in the area. When such loans are made they are largely based upon land value. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6,000 in 1929, $3750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4750. The same home would have rented for $60 in 1929, $37.50 in 1933, and $47.50 now.'}}},\n",

Inhabitants of the area consist largely of small business men, \"white collar\" workers, skilled and semi-skilled artisans etc., having incomes ranging from $1200 to $3000. There are very few single-family residences in the area which is zoned second-residential and business. Improvements consist largely of middle-class apartments and flats with a strong tendency toward a better grade of apartment houses. In the area is located one of the State Normal Schools, and the new U.S. Mint is also under construction. The single-family residences in the area are from 40 to 50 years old, and had a cost range when new of from $3500 to $7500. They are 70% owner-occupied with a 5% vacancy. Schools, transportation facilities, and recreational areas are favorably located, and its nearness to the shopping centers is also an advantage. The area is 100% developed and a high assessed value of lands would seem to preclude any new construction of single-family residences. But very few mortgagee institutions will consider loans on one to four-family units, and any such loans would be hazardous except upon the basis of land value. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $4500 in 1929, $3000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3750.

The southwestern section contains a large part of what is known as Nob Hill which is occupied by many high-grade apartment houses, hotels, etc. The far-famed Chinatown of San Francisco adjoins this area on the east and southeast, but owing to the topography this is not thought to constitute an undue threat. This area suffered the heaviest damage in the City at the time of the earthquake and fire of 1906 and has been practically all rebuilt since that time. This is a distinctly Italian area insofar as one to four-family units are concerned, and many of the old Italian families have homes here. Single-family residences have an average age of 25 years and are valued at from $4,000 to $15,000 being 75% owner-occupied with a very few vacancies. The area is 95% developed and there is a distinct threat of encroachment by business and apartment houses. Schools of all grades are conveniently near, and transportation facilities are excellent. It also has the advantage of being near the business and shopping centers. High assessment values makes single-family residential ownership a burden, and none of the mortgagee institutions entertain applications for loans on one to four-family units in this area except in the extreme northern part and then upon very much modified terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6500 in 1929, $5,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5750.

This area is zoned first-residential, with the exception of a strop along Capitol and Plymoth Streets which is zoned for business. Homes are approximately 80% owner-occupied, 15% rented, and 5% vacant. Schools of all grades and transportation facilities are conveniently available. Balboa Pakr joins the area on the north, and Ocean View Playgrounds is in the area, both of which add to desirability. However, a gravel pit and car barns which adjoin on the northeast, and the railroad spur tracks which bound and traverse the area constitute detrimental influences.

A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5,000 in 1929, $3750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4250. The same home would have rented for $47.50 in 1929, $35.00 in 1933, and $40,00 now.'}}},\n",

It has comparatively level topography. The area as a whole is 45 years old, and its inhabitants include people from almost every stratum of society. It is occupied by laborers and factory workers with incomes of from $1000 to $2000 and by \"white collar\" workers, city employees, and shop-keepers with incomes ranging from $1500 to $3,000. There is no racial concentration, but people of Irish extract might be said to predominate. There is no immediate threat of undesirable racial infiltration but such an eventually is distinctly possible. Maintenance in the area is extremely varied and spotted. Some of the intermingling blocks show distinct pride of ownership, while others are indicative of slum conditions. Single-family residences range in value all the way from $2,000 to $7500, and consist of varied types of architecture and construction. The area is zoned second-residential but many blocks are given over to business. Multi-family dwellings, flats and apartments abound throughout the area, and that part lying north of 18th Street might almost be classed \"commercial\" as it contains but few single-family dwellings and a large percentage is given over to business; many shops, markets, and stores, and a few semi-industrial establishments being located here. Single-family dwellings are 70% owner-occupied with about 25% tenancy, and 5% vacancy. Schools and transportation facilities are conveniently available, and parks and recreational areas are near. The Mission Dolores, one of the oldest structures in the City, is located in this area. Climatic conditions in this section are the most equitable in the City, and many residents will live in no other section. Officials of mortgagee institutions are very favorably disposed toward the Mission District of which this area is a part. However, it is very generally recognized that each application must be judged upon the merits of the sectary offer, and terms modified accordingly. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6,000 in 1929, $4,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5,000. The same home would have rented for $55 in 1929, $37.50 in 19333, and $45 now.'}}},\n",

The class of occupancy, which had been slowly changing to lower income groups, has shown a recent tendency to change this trend.  The recent purchase of a new high school site one block to the south of the area and the possibility of the development of a high-grade residential area on the eastern boundary has had a beneficial effect upon the area, and it is thought may in time increase the grade of its eastern part.  The area's natural advantages and the general tone of the whole district is comfirmatory of this opinion.\",\n",
