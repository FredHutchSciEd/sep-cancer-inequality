# Cleaning

Most of the scripts are associated with a single dataset. To perform the cleaning, run all the scripts except `nci_processing.ipynb` and `merge.ipynb`. Then run `nci_processing.ipynb` to join the state and county level NCI data. Finally, run `merge.ipynb` to merge the county and state level datasets together.
