                <h3>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.fredhutch.org">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center</a> unites comprehensive care and
                    advanced research to provide the latest
                    cancer treatment options and accelerate discoveries that prevent, treat and defeat cancer and
                    infectious diseases worldwide.

                    Based in Seattle, Fred Hutch is an independent, nonprofit organization and the only National Cancer
                    Institute-designated cancer center in Washington. We have earned a global reputation for our track
                    record of discoveries in cancer, infectious disease and basic research, including important advances
                    in bone marrow transplantation, HIV/AIDS prevention, immunotherapy and COVID-19 vaccines. Fred Hutch
                    operates eight clinical care sites that provide medical oncology, infusion, radiation, proton
                    therapy and related services and has network affiliations with hospitals in four states. Fred Hutch
                    also serves as UW Medicine's cancer program.</p>

                <h3>Science Education Partnership</h3>
                <p>The <a

                        Education Partnership (SEP)</a> at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center is a professional
                    development program for secondary science teachers that has been sponsored by Fred Hutch since 1990.
                    SEP has a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and makes the resources for hands-on
                    biology available to schools that could otherwise not afford them. Since its inception, over 600
                    science teachers have participated, reaching over 400,000 students.

                    Create a walkthrough that provides a guided exploration of the data
                    <a href="walkthrough.html">here</a>. We have created some walkthrough tutorials to highlight some of
                    the relationships that exist in the data.

                            Lung Cancer Mortality and Smoking Rates</a>: This highlights a strong positive relationship between deaths from lung cancer and smoking
                        rates. This relationship is expected because smoking is a known cause of lung cancer.

                        cervical cancer.
